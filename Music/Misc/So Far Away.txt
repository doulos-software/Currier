Intro: [VI] [IV] [V] [I] [VII] [I] [VII]

(Verse)
[I]I am right here with you
[VI]I couldn't be more close
[IV]Pretending that I'm in this moment
[IV]When I'm only a ghost
[I]I listen to the words you're saying
[VI]Words I'm fighting to believe
[IV]It's like I'm living from a distance
[IV]And you're just out of reach

(Pre-Chorus)
[I]I wanna feel it when I mean it when I say it
[V]Can you hear me at all

And I [VI]feel so [IV]far away, [I]far away from [V]everything
[VI]Outside [IV]wondering [I]when I got [V]lost
[VI]I threw my arms up [IV]in the air, [I]why do I [V]disappear
[II]How can your [III]love be so [IV]close
When I'm [V]so far [I]away

(Verses are the same as before)
[I]Remember when you found me drowning
[VI]You pulled me from the deepest end
[IV]I promised that I'll never leave you
[IV]Now I'm drowning again
[I]It's killing me with every breath
[VI]Witnessing the life I lived
[IV]Only you know who I am
[IV]I'm reaching out my hand

(Pre-Chorus)

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
[IV]And I don't wanna waste time
[VI]Living a half life
[I]Are you listening
[I]Now give it back to me
[IV]I remember everything
[VI]The way it used to be
[I]You give it back to me
[I]You give it back to me
[II]I hear your voice
[III]But inside I'm [IV]lost

(Chorus)
