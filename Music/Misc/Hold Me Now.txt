Capo 1
INTRO: Bm D
VERSE 1:
Bm D
Fall asleep to dreams of home where the waves are crashing;
Bm D
The only place I've ever known now the future has me;
Bm D
I see the fire in the sky, see it all around me;
A Bm G
I said the past was dead the life I had is gone;
A Bm G
Said I won't give up until I see the sun.
,b>VERSE 2:
Bm D
Waking up and letting go, to the sound of angels;
Bm D
Am I alive or just a ghost, haunted by my sorrows?
Bm D
Hope is slipping through my hands; gravity is taking hold;
A Bm G
I said I'm not afraid, that I am brave enough
A Bm G
I will not give up until I see the sun.
Key: D
D Asus Bm G
Hold me now, 'til the fear is leaving, I am barely breathing.
D A Bm G
Hold me now, 'til the fear is leaving, I am barely breathing.
D A Bm G
Crying out, these tired wings are falling, I need You to catch me.
