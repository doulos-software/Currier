Modes


The term mode refers to which note in a key is the root note in a piece of music.  Each key has seven possible modes:

I	~ Ionian
II	~ Dorian
III	~ Phrygian
IV 	~ Lydian
V	~ Mixolydian
VI	~ Aeolian
VII	~ Lydian


When we say C-Major, this scale is synonomous with C-Ionian; meaning the scale has the notes of the Key of C and begins with the 1st tone - C.

D-Dorian has also has the notes of the Key of C but begins on the 2nd tone - D.

However, this is all theoretical.  The usefulness of modes is in the relationship between chords and scales.
	A standard chord progression is I, IV, V.  In the Major scale, in the Key of C, this means Cmaj, Fmaj, Gmaj.

	What's interesting is that a standard C chord progression will always be C, F, & G.  The qualities of the chords will vary depending on the mode.  So, a C chord progression in Mixolydian is Cmaj, Fmaj, Gmin; which is is the Key of F.

	This also explains the relative minor (Aeolian).  For instance, A-Aeolian is in the Key of C rooted on the 6th tone - A.  The A-Aeolian (or minor) chord progression is Amin, Dmin, Emin.
