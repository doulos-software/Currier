# Many or All

There is precedent for understanding _many_ and _all_ as interchangeable.
However, the textual distinction remains.


## Isaiah 53

6) All
All have "gone astray" thus He bore "the inquity of us **all**"

11-12) Many
**many** will be accounted righteous
a portion with the **many**
He bore the sin of **many**

Can it be said that the remedy was meant for all but only accepted by a few?
Obviously, if there are some unsaved, there is something not applied to all - but just to the many?
