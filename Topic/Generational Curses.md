# Generational Curses
...are a dangerous lie

[Jer 31:29+]()
- This passage explicitly states that Yahweh takes a personal view of salvation
- He does not attribute a prior generation's fault to this one

[Ex 20]()
- The decalogue gives high-level, personal view of Yahweh's interaction with us

### Do we suffer because of our parents or ancestors?
Yes, sometimes!
We may very well suffer because of another person's stupid choice(s).
However, our salvation is never [Biblically] dependent on another's actions.

### Imaging
"Taking the Lord's name" refers to bearing/carrying the image of God **on purpose**.
This is a personal decision and affects our life...other's indirectly (note the circular pointer back to ancestral affects.)
