# Empty Hands


In truth, we all come empty handed before Yahweh.
One day, every knee will bow before Him and every tongue will confess who He is.
So many heroes of the faith pre-dated the law as if to expose the lack of our need for it.
Many more were gentle pagans who simply believed.
Even the great Israelite heroes were parodies against the backdrop of Yahweh's throne of grace.
