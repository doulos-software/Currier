Footstool


[Lev 16] ~ the lid of the ark

[Num 7:89]


Rather than calling the lid of the ark "mercy seat" is it *kapporet* ~ place of purging - 'instrument of propitiation' OR __throne__
	_mercy_ is a commentary of the object's purpose rather than a translation of what it is


Elsewhere the ark is referred to as God's footstool:
	[1Chr 28:2]
	[Ps 99:5]
	[Ps 132:7]
	[Lam 2:1]
