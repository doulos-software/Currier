Most Good

[Num 18:9-10]
	The terminology "most holy" is used to describe sacrifices which were to nourish the priest(s).
	This corresponds roughly to the "very good" day of creation which is when man began to participate with God in work.
	-> sacrifices made to Yehovah were, preemptively, given to the priesthood for their nourishment.
	-> these were to be eaten in a holy place; as indwelt believers we are the holy place...
