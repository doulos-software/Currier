Self Sacrifice


[Matt 25:35-36]
For I was hungry and you gave me food
  Give food
I was thirsty and you gave me drink
  Give drink
I was a stranger and you welcomed me
  Give privacy
I was naked and you clothed me
  Give garments
I was sick and you visited me
  Give health
I was in prison and you came to me
  Give time
  Give safety
