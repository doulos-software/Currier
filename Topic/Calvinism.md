Calvinism


The Doctrines of Grace
"TULIP"

Total Depravity
	original sin

Unconditional Election

Limited Atonement
	particular atonement

Irresistible Grace
	
Perseverance of the Saints
	"once saved always saved"
	soteriological security


The main issue for the modern Church is: none of these doctrines should be divisive.
But they are.
Even "once saved...always..." need not be a doctrinally divisive issue; it's sad to see a brother/sister fret over security but it doesn't preclude fellowship.
Really, the only dogmatic philosophies are those which are Christological (Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection) because they undergird our need for salvation and His provision of it.
