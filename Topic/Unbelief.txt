Unbelief


The mere fact that Psalms 37, 53, 73, 78, and 106 were written, not to mention the hymns "Begone Unbelief" (Newton) and "Help My Unbelief" (Gadsby), tells me that I'm not alone in disbelieving at times and having my faith shaken.
David, the man after God's own heart, disbelieved {1 Sam 27:1}.
I have experienced God to extents that give me chills when remembering yet I still disbelieve at times.

A teacher of mine used to say, "the fact that you're worried about it means you don't have to worry about it."
It's somewhat trite...but true.
There would not be such a great fight, nor inner turmoil, if there were no spiritual battle being fought.
To paraphrase Descartes: "we could not imagine righteous God if He had not given us the ability to do so."

I like the analogy of life as a climbing path up a rock face.
Periodically a piton is driven in to break a fall - and there will be falls.
The more of these anchor points there are the better off we are in a fall - if one gives way it will slow the momentum for the next piton to catch us.

Life experiences and profound lessons create these anchor points.
As a youngster we fail more often and don't have the confidence of looking down to see many pitons.
The bottom One will always hold...but sometimes that fact must be tested.
After all, we cannot truly know a thing without experience.

The danger is that we mistake our experiences for reality.
This is mystical fallacy and it's fruit is legalism or license.
[2Pet 1:10] ~ we are instructed to obtain security, and this is wraught through _practicing_ good character.
The goal is to have the assurance of faith that comes from Him by knowing Him by seeking to imitate Him.

[Ps 84]
[Num 7:89]
[John 13:25]
