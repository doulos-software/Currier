	God's temple
	you are

[1Cor 6:-]
	body is a temple
	Holy Spirit within

[2Cor 5:1-5]
	tent
	building
	house

[2Cor 6:14-]
	believers vs. unbelievers ~ temple vs. idol
	[Lev 26]

[2Pet 1:13-]
	body ~ skeinoma, skin-tent

The point here is that the new testament writers understood the living allegory of the Church as the temple.
This may imply the Ezekiel's temple is not a literal temple
1. There are no height dimensions given
2. The imagers as the temple is a Biblical concept
3. The cosmic mountain theme ties the temple to the greater, incorporeal, spiritual war

[Eze 43:13-17]

Levinson states that the creation account (esp. [Gen 2]) is akin to a cosmic temple building project
...notable in light of the Church/temple paradigm

i.e. the glory of Christ is in the body, we are the body, which is the cosmic mountain, via which He runs His redemption program

[Rev 21,22] ~ no temple in heaven


[Lev 25:8-10] ~ 50yr Jubilee
	?Jubilee dimensions? of Ezekiel's temple
	[Eze 40:1]
	Two things link Ezekiel's temple to the Jubilee:
	- the Jubilee began on 10 Tishri
	- 25th year

1 Tishri =
	birth of Jesus
	inauguration of new king

1-9 Tishri ~ probably a new-year celebration time

10x50 = 10 Jubilees
