Arguments of Totality


Example: Was the flood global?
	It is possible to make a valid, evangelical, textual defense of a local or global flood.

Bottom line: such arguments cannot be used to demonstrate a person's committment to inspiration or allegiance to Yahweh.
We must remember that the Bibilical authors had a [completely] different paradigm.


[Gen 10]
	There are 70 nations listed here
	It is invalid to assume that this is an exhaustive list of nations on the entire globe, but that is the wording here
	...therefore, we understand that terms like "whole earth" are not geographic but ?synedoche? (some figure of speech)

[Joel 2:28]
	Yahweh's Spirit shall be poured out on "all flesh"
	...does this mean everyone partakes in the Spirit?
		No, we know this from practical experience and [1Cor 3:16]
		Now, might this refer to a time when Yahweh is revealed afer the new creation?
		...if so then why must there be visions and dreams, this seems to imply a time where there is active evangelism
