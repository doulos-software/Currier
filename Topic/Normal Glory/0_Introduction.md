It is probably the case that we will arrive on the shores of the glass sea and, viewing our wives and mothers next to Jesus (from afar), will realize what a blurred, dim reflection of the Maker we really are.  But we are imagers nonetheless.  And if there are, as I suspect, as many instantiations of spiritual gifts as
Believers - then there are at least as many implementations of incorporating believers.  But there are right and wrong ways for us to organize.  There are good and bad practices.  This is what I wish to explore herein.

At first, the word "incorporating" stings a bit.  I am diametrically opposed to the modern church-as-business model of congregating.  However, don't you know that we believers are the temple of Yahweh.  We are simultaneously one building as well as the blocks that make it up.
