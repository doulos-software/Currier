Normal Glory
...the prevalence of relevance thinking and the evaporation of orthodoxy in the institutionalized Church...


Orthodoxy is a lighthouse, not a wall.

What is normative in the Church (sacrificial giving, true reconciliation of people with their creator and each other, spiritual intimacy) is not normal in common society - and this is, likewise, true in the institutionalized Church.
The Institution is any and all incorporated congregations of believers whose culture and worship is predominantly extra-Biblical.
Examples of common extra-Biblical pursuits are real-estate, idolatrous prayer, foundational extra-biblical studies, and worshipless fellowship and meals.
This boils down to a lack of orthodoxy (nominal beliefs) and orthopraxy (nominal practices).
The result is malnourishment: physical, emotional, and spiritual.

Centuries of high church and culturally driven orthopraxy have divorced Church members from their reality as sojourning citizens of a heaven.
We are, essentially, diplomats who require meetings together to maintain our health and sanity.
Furthermore the Institution propagates the divide between clergy and laity.
Such a divide is not Godly.
Yahweh rebukes priests who abuse their station: think of Aaron's sons or Elli's.

We have operated under the faulty notion that the Institution is necessary and remediable.
It is a circular rut that the Institution implements vicarious ministries which are only operable by a clergy (implying that there are _called_ among the "called").
Also, the spiritual gifts are not fully realizable or performant in the Institution:
Not all members will/can serve;
Gifts are feckless in a corporate faculty.
Not to mention that Institutional leadership structure is synthetic - not natural.
[Ps 115:8] those who make it [the institutionâ€‹] become like it

There are four dogmatic Church orthopraxy: apostolic teaching, fellowship, commensality, and prayer [Acts 2:42]
These are at best artificial in and, sadly, often absent from the Institution.
It is a travesty that institutionalised Christians miss out on the truest forms of these practices.

The hope in this research is to explore and exposit the issues involved in a mass believers' defection from the Institution.
Much of this research I need for myself and my family.
However, I've been personally confronted with multiple families and individuals who are greatly disillusioned with the Institution.
But this is a great point of hope, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer states: disillusionment with man's estate reminds us of our reality in Jesus Christ.

Bottom line: the Church is not a place or time.
It is a demographic.
When there is no longer good Bible study, and biblical worship, and Christlike shepherding then you are left with a social club.
The purely social congregation cannot help but lapse into moralism - it has nothing left but the desire to be like the thing it is not: the Church.
Forget that the Institution can flourish under good leadership.
This is not the mark of the Church nor it's mission.
