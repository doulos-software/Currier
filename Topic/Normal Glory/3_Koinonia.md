Koinonia


The fellowship of an assembly.
A gathering of people's who believe in Jesus Christ is no idle thing.
There is no predisposition to corporate machinations as with synthetic religion.

Beyond the prescriptions of [Acts 2:42] there are commandments to:
- baptize
- eat the Lord's supper
- teach Scripture

It is natural for people to gather:
- near their home
- with people they know and like
- at a regular time

...but none of these things are mandatory nor prescribed **anywhere**.
