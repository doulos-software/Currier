= a sacred space

Ultimately the Church is the sacred space.
However, the Church is a demographic - not a time or place.
So, the definition is necessarily bifurcated.

[1Cor 3:16]
  "you are God's template" is this personal or corporate?  It's both...but note that the individual is not a brick in a wall, he is the whole thing.
  "dwells in you" implies that worship, sacrifice, and conversation occur within the believer **and** the Church.
