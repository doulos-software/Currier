# Knowledge & Wisdom


## Can be Earned


## Can be Gifted

[1Cor 2:-12]
	the Spirit of God has been gifted
	...which helps us understand "what has been freely given"
	What has been given?  Discernment regarding the cause of Christ: v.7-9

[1Jon 2:27]
	The Spirit teaches us - what?
	Again, wisdom is given by God subsequent to the knowledge given by man (v.24)
