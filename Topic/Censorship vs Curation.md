Censorship vs. Curation
	data-oriented eldership


It's difficult to know how much to lockdown a child.  Some parents take a lassez-faire approach to their stewardship.  Others are very strict.  It should be difficult for us to fault either because A) we are not them and B) our children are not theirs.
	From a teliological basis of Yahweh's providence over parenting we must conclude that He knit together the family in the same way he knit together our bodies [Ps 139] and the Church [Eph 1].  i.e. He gave you what children he did on purpose.
	From a theological perspective is it also true that being raised in a family is the most formative event in a human life.  Second to that is parenting.  This is true no matter what form the family takes - deformations, defects, and divisions abound.

All that to say that it may be best to withhold access to certain information from your child.  Or, perhaps, your child may be edified and wizened by information that would damage another child.  This is a conundrum that cannot be solved by a purely scholarly work - suffice it to say that there must involvement by other people.
	However, an issue we can resolve is the _manner_ in which this information is withheld.  There are two pieces involved here: access and intent.

Access comes in two forms (from a geek perspective): black-list and white-list.  In short
- Black-list ~ you are allowed to see everything except what is on the list
- White-list ~ you are only allowed to see what is on the list
	Hopefully it obvious that the first is reactive and the second is intensive.  It is possible to employ a mix of these two by categorizing information.
	Also, practically speaking, we tend to implement access control using both because we can never fully anticipate needs nor fully encapsulate data.

Intent is the reason for providing the information.  Are we teaching?  Are we simply allowing them some recreation?
	Intent must be deliberate or we risk opening the floodgates and being inundated via our own control scheme.
	Further, intent dictates our involvement with the act of information absorption as well.  A child is not necessarily capable of taking in information beneficially - neither are they necessarily capable of drawing truthful conclusions from it (neither are you either (necessarily)).


Now we have a foundation on which to distinguish censorship and curation.  First, lay out your presuppositions: given your ability to do so is it ever prudent to completely remove a piece of information (book, video) from your child's existence?  i.e. If you could would you eliminate you son's access to pornography for all time?
	Further, is that potentially damaging information which you ought to present to your child before someone else does?  I think that's obvious as well.  Issues like intelligent design and sex and illicit drug-use must be brought forward by the parent _first_.

Censorship is merely the removal of information.  It is blocking internet addresses and burning books.  It is not, ever, ultimately successful.  Generally information is never really lost and confidential things breed covetousness.

Curation, on the other hand, is a metering of experience.  The steward decides what and when to present to the one under their care.  Curation is just as deliberate as censorship but is regressive rather than final.  Eventually the child will be independent and will have access to all the information you withheld.  The great question is: will they desire to go after the things which are damaging?
	The answer to that question lies in the method you chose to employ in providing them data.  Without a purposeful methodology with the goal of their benefit that answer will likely be yes.
