# My Name Is


Only twice does the LORD proclaim His name via this phase, "My Name is."

[Ex 34:14] ~ Qanna (Jealous)

[Is 57:15] ~ Qadowsh (Holy)

[Jer 32:18]
[Jer 46:18]
[Jer 48:15]
[Jer 51:57] ~ LORD of hosts

[Amos 5:27] ~ God of hosts

[Ps 68:4]
[Ps 83:18]
[Jer 16:21] ~ Yahweh


In [Mal 1:14] the LORD gives a characteristic of His name: it is dreadful - antithetically inspiring.
Likewise, [Is 52:5] has God expositing the hatred of His name.
