# Choosing a church


The central message of a ministry is _defining_.

Typical congregations today are not heterdox - they don't have enough theological depth to **be** heretical.

For the Church fathers all subjects were subservient to Christology.
- NOT self-improvement
- NOT foretelling the future


Haramatiology and saving faith are important foundational topics necessary for good Christology.


There is an important distinction between a "transformation of sinners" and the Person and work of Christ.
The latter must be at the forefront of a good ministry.

The distinction is that we are to focus on Christ whose work which granted us great favor.
