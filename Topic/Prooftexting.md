# Prooftexting
...the act of proving a supposition or argument based on individual verses or passages of Scripture.

## The Old Method

This may be a touchy subject because purveyors of this method are, notably, trying to establish truth based on the Biblical text.
However, it is a faulty process to _prove_ an idea based on anything less than the whole of Scripture.
The notion that we simply aggregate a list of all verses which apply to a certain idea and comment on them is seriously flawed.

Here are some specific downfalls to this method:
- versification is not inspired, it is very late and was simply scribal input
- narrow lexical context is inherently dubious
- meta-information is lost in truncated quotations

### Versification

### Context

### Meta-Info


## The New Method

Instead of attempting to plow under the idea of prooftexting we should find a new paradigm where it makes sense and achieves the desired end: preaching the truth.


In this context "prove" means to test and strain and idea the same way the metals are melted and the slag removed.

When proving an idea it is necessary to
1st - glean the associated Biblical principles;
2nd - collect passages which are related
3rd - understand the historical context of the passages' occurrence
	- note that the authorship, the actual writing down of the passage as we have it, probably never conincides with the event
4th - understand the literary context of the passages
	- what genre are they?
	- who is the intended audience?
	- who is the story about?
	- what is it's placement in the story of Christ?

Armed with this background research it is possible to then begin to reason about any issue in light of Scripture.
