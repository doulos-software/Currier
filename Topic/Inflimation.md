## Implication vs. Inference

To imply means that the giver intends a subjunctive or rhetorical meaning.

To infer is to draw out such meaning.
However, we fallibles so often impose or project meaning where the author gives none.

The difficulty here is that an meaning can be providentially woven into a text by the orchestration of the author's life.
This meaning can only be had by recognizing and shelving your own presuppositions.


## Deduction vs. Induction

Deduction is gleaning truth from a source.

Induction is deriving truth via proposing and evaluating arguments that match the supposed truth.

Both of these are valid forms of study but depends heavily on the examiner objectivity.
