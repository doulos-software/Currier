# Soul Sleep

The idea of soul-sleep was absent in the ancient near-east.

The common belief of the Hebrews was encapsulated in being "gather to their fathers".
i.e. burying people with belonging implies the belief that they thought the afterlife was a physical existence.

[Is 14:9] ~ conscience interaction of dead people

Further, contact with the dead was forbidden - why if the dead are "asleep"?
...and, spirits don't die (only humans do).
