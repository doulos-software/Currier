# Name Theology


Yahweh is referred to _as_ His name.
The name is applied to His followers..

A common sticking point for readers in understanding Name Theology is
- that the biblical narrative appears to have a single author
- however, the text was obviously written and edited by multiple people

The answer to this is that Yahweh purposely includes humans in the process of creating and transmitting Scripture and superintends the entire process.

The needful determination is the nature of The Name.
Is it...
- Hypostasis?
- Literacy?
- 

The substance of JEDP is the evolution of thought about Yahweh.
In conjunction with Name Theology this is relevant: humanity is more and more cognizant of the unchanging truth.

Attributes of the Name:
- it is owned
- is placed
