# Quickening


In pregnancy this is the moment when the mother first perceives s fetal presence. 
This is an apt perplexity because Jesus analogizes our familial inclusion with birth.
We also remember how JtB leaped in Elizabeth's womb. 

So, the quickening is of the mother - not the child. 
Also, the conception is a deliberate act whose mechanics are well understood (and often practiced).

Further,  the carrying of the child is deliberate. 
Mom will, from the quickening, both cognitively and naturally, restructure her self to accommodate the child. 

Thirdly, the birth is deliberate. 
It can really be done anywhere; though extensive plans are often made. 
It is also largely unavoidable.
