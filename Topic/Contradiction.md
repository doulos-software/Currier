# Contradiction

Non-contradiction is necessary for rational thought.

Some apparent contradictions reveal misunderstanding or unattainable paradigms.

e.g. Light
    Under certain circumstances light behaves like a particle.
    Under other circumstances lights behaves like a wave.
    It is neither, we simply lack framework to fully understand it.

Interestingly, light is something beyond understanding until we measure it - then it behaves in a particular way that we do understand.

Reason and doubt are compatible with faith.
