Salt


In ancient times salt was a preservative and a condiment.

The salt they used was not pure salt as we have today but, often, diluted by other minerals (or dirt).


## Lifeblood

Meat with blood in it was forbidden to Israelites because of the life-taking connection.
Meat "treated" or rendered with salt was good to eat...barring cookery.

Interesting parallel with the Church:
	The world = [Mic 3:1-3]
	Believers = [Matt 5:13]
