Why did God create Adam? us?

to function as He designed us

image-bearers ~= representatives

decreed to create
    art + usefulness
    modeled after Yahweh

worship
    we are the work of Yahweh's hands
    the work of our hands' is our output
    ...does it cause us the worship the Creator? or the thing? or ourselves?

economics
    [Gen 1:26-28]
    dominion + subdue
    ~ steward + overcome
    ~ creation + recreation/molding
    ...stems from identity

    Tabernacle
        many people produced pieces of the whole, as prescribed by Yahweh
    
    flourishing ~ [Ps 1]
