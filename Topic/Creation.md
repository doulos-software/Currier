Nothing is withheld from us that we conceived to do.
Russell Kirsch

Some have a propensity to dismiss their intuition and instinct - both Christians and Atheists, for different reasons.
The former believes it to be a base, unfit residual from the _old man_.
The latter believes it to be a vestigial leftover from a lesser ancestor.
Both are wrong for the same reason: these are innate abilities programmed into us.
