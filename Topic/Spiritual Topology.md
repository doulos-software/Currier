# Spiritual Topology

Topology is a study of the shape of a space.

Navigating a space requires a coordinate system, made up of dimensioanl axes.
The shape of a space is governed by the relationship between axes.

Necessarily, spiritual topology is a space whose axes are indivisible doctrinal ideas.
Position in an ideal equates to position in a dimension.
Interrelations between doctrines governs the shape of the overall space, which is the theology.


There are some interesting spatial notions in Scripture.
It is important to note that these rarely include time or cardinality.
Often, timelines and hierarchies are induced rather than deduced when it comes to Biblical thought.


## [Ps 103]
The driving idea in this song is the desire to convey gratitude to Yahweh:
- as Majesty
- as Giver
- as Healer
- as Redeemer
- as Satisfier

So, while this work does not contradict natural law it is not intended to convery scientific meaning, but spiritual.

11) "as high as the heavens are above the earth"

Ancient man thought that the heavens were a shell covering the disc of the earth.
We now know that the heavens are much further away.
This is a long distance but not interminable.
With this in mind our current knowledge shows Yahweh's love to be greater than ever imagined.
Note the caveat: "toward those who fear him"

12) "as far as the east is from the west"

Again, ancient thought perceived this distance to be finite; large, perhaps unknowable to us, but finite.
We now know that this distance is, in fact, infinite.
You can travel east forever; hence, the reason scholars often eschew categoricals involving "east" and "west".

17) "from everlasting to everlasting"

An important mathematical note about the foreverness of Yahweh.
Recall that when Moses was present His message it's origin was named, "I Am that I Am".
A pedantic, though correct, interpretation would simply be that Yahweh occupies all things.

19) "His throne in the heavens"

An interesting side-note to re-invigorate the idea that God has physicality and is interested in physical/temporal things.


## [Col 1]

17) "He is before all things"

Again we have a mathematical exposition.
This gets to the heart of the matter: God must be the origin or all else fails.

The personhood of Yahweh even predates knowledge and wisdom [Prov 8:22].

17) "in Him all things hold together"

Here we begin to see the incorporation of dimensionality.
There are many disparate ideas and ideals which are only conjoined in a theology.
This passage is about the preemminence of God in relation to all other powers;
However, we mustn't fail to see that the language does not discount _all else_.
vv.15-16 systematically broaden the scope of God's power from personhood to **all**.

The aim of this enterprise of incarnation and dominance is not arbitrary: it is reconciliation.
For the purposes of the current topic, suffice it to say that the union of the ideals is that Yahweh is the framework of the topology.
