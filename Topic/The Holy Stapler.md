The Holy Stapler


Gen 14:4 = When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.


But...the territory of Dan didn't exist in Abraham's time, that city/area was know a Laish.
So, it's apparent that this passage was edited later.
This doesn't necessarily undermine Mosaic authorship, just identifies that the Biblical text has been edited/stewarded through the ages.

Another notable example is Ezekiel 1 where we have both 1st and 3rd person references.

In fact, this continues throughout Church history.
The Septuagint originally had 46 books - whereas the Hebrew Tanakh had 22.

The original Catholic Bible had ?78? (latin).

We have 3 different traditions of Hebrew manuscripts for our Canon all in close agreement and dating from Jesus' time.
We have several complete copies of the new testament scriptures from 2nd and 3rd century sources which agree closely.

This term 'close agreement' has no negative impact on essential doctrines (or even (my opinion) secondary doctrines).
In fact, this transmission of Scripture through time is even more amazing when we see the hand of man involved and the precise quality of the Word which is delivered to us.
