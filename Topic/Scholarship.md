# Scholarship

God has ordained a priesthood which, as a whole, will ferret out the truth of Scripture.


Exegetical
	translation
	hermeneutics

Theological
	areas (creation, anthropology, hamartiology)
	symbolics (confession, etc)
	apologetics

	a good theologian stops where the text does
	...this end, however, is affected by the presuppositions (thus the humility) of the scholar
	...we can say that scripture interprets scripture but, still, there is humanity involved in making the linkage

Historical
	what the Church _has_ taught

Practical
	homiletics
	liturgics
	missiology
	


Lex errendi lex credende
