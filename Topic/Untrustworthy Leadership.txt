Untrustworthy Leadership


{Heb 13:7} - Don’t trust leaders who can’t get the job done, even if they are wonderful people.

It takes more than good character to be a trustworthy leader. Don’t trust leaders who can’t get the job done, even if they are wonderful people.

An incompetent leader — who tells the truth — is an untrustworthy leader. {1Tim 4:16}

{Ez 34}

5 ways to deal with untrustworthy leaders:

 2. Determine if the issue is character or competence. Remove leaders who lack character.

 3. Maximize their strengths.

 4. Compensate for their weaknesses.

 5. On a personal level, continue doing a great job, but protect yourself.
