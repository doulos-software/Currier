# Messianic Prophecies


Posterity
  [Ps 22]
    Bulls of Bashan
    - Bulls are a sign of kingship, authority
    - Bashan, the place of the serpent, 
      - Hosea: cows of Bashan, i.e. women who worshipped Baal
    piercings ~ crucifixion was not yet invented


Dual Interpretation
  [Zech 11:10+]


Virgin Birth
  [Is 9:6-8]
  - a baby
  - a boy
  - ruler
  - peace-maker
  - vast dominion
    - the original promise was Nile to Euphrates


Explicit X-refs:
  Out of Egypt
    [Matt 2:13-15,19-21]
    [Hos 11:1]
    ...licensed, but inspired

  Weeping Ramah
    [Matt 2:16-18]
    [Jer 31:15]


Suffering Servant
  [Is 50:6]
  [Is 53:7] ~ [Matt 27:12-14]


Genealogies
  Mark ~ no genealogy
  - because Mark protrays Jesus servant nature there is no need for one

  [John 1:1-3]()
  - divine heritage
  - the Beginnor
  - the Maker

  Matt 1
  - The paternal Jewish lineage
  - Abraham -> David -> Christ
  - "and his brothers" ~ all Israel
  - by Tamar
  - by Rahab
  - by Ruth
  - by _the wife of Uriah_ (Bathsheba, not an innocent dove as often portrayed)
  - the exile___the line continues, changed
  - of Mary
  - 

  Luke 3:23
  - the maternal, human lineage
  - no gentiles listed here [after Abraham]
  - about, thought to
  - [Luke 3:27] ~ [Matt 1:12]
  - [Luke 3:31] ~ [2Sam 5:14]
  - [Luke 3:32] ~ [Matt 1:6] ~ [1Chr 2:10-11]
  - [Luke 3:33] ~ [Matt 1:4] ~ [1Chr 2:9-10]
  - [Luke 3:34] ~ [Gen 25:26] ~ [Gen 21:3]
  - [Luke 3:35] ~ [Gen 10:24-25]
  - 38 generations...obvious gaps

Circumstances
  John the Baptist
  - [Luke 3:3-6]
  - [Is 40:3-5]

  Scepter of Judah
  - [Gen 49:10]()
  - the right of Israel to self-governance
    - manifested as corporal punishment
  - taken away under Roman rule shortly after Jesus' birth
  - ...so, Jewish leadership thought the "scepter" to be broken
  - ...but the Messiah had come
  - [Ps 60:7](), [Ps 108:8]()
    - Judah **is** the scepter
    - Christ comes via Judah "and his brothers" [Matt 1:2]()

 
Date Setting
  - [Dan 9]()
    - given by Gabriel, who is always messaging Messianic stuff
    - ...the time matches multiple ways
      1. 1335 days until Alexander crossed the Dardanelles
      2. 483yr until the crucifixion: from 458BC ~ 25BC 
    - why date-setting is stupid:
      - not all "years" are the same
        - 46BC was 445 days long...by Imperial decree
        - the Essenes desired a 364 day year
        - the lunar calendar is 360 days
        - ours is 365.25
      - not to mention the great difficulty in pinpointing dates
        - 586BC demolition of Jerusalem is know from astronomical data
        - 3BC death of Herod is known from coinage studies
