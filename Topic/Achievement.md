# Achievement

What is God's greatest achievement?
There are two ways to measure this:
1. How much revelation is devoted to it.
2. How much did it cost Him.

e.g. Creation
1. First part of Genesis; a few Psalms; some sections here & there.
2. He "breathed it out".

im. Redemption
1. Most of the Book.
2. His son.
