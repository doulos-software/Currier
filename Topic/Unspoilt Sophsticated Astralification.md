Unspoilt, Sophsticated Astralification


We began our existence in an unspoilt condition.
God always held together the created fabric of each being, but His doing so was never in doubt.
Our faithfulness, however, was dubious.

After the fall humanity developed civilizations and patriarchal, cultic societies.
God did not immediately condescend to show us the perfect way to conduct human culture.
Rather, He taught us - via the law - the utter depravity and need of man.
He did this teaching in the context of the ancient near eastern society.

The ultimate goal of Yahweh is His own glorification.
We have a seat at the divine council awaiting us.
The language of star-stuff is used for the future of the elect.
