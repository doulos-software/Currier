Normal Glory
...the prevalence of relevance thinking and the evaporation of orthodoxy
in the institutionalized Church...


Orthodoxy is a lighthouse, not a wall.

What is normative in the Church (sacrificial giving, true reconciliation of people with their creator and each other, spiritual intimacy) is not normal in common society - and this is, likewise, true in the institutionalized Church.
The Institution is any and all incorporated congregations of believers whose culture and worship is predominantly extra-Biblical.
Examples of common extra-Biblical pursuits are real-estate, lack of orthodoxy (corporate prayer, Biblical exegesis), and lack of orthopraxy (fellowship and meals).
This boils down to a lack of nourishment: physical, emotional, and spiritual.

Centuries of high church and culturally driven orthopraxy have divorced Church members from their reality as sojourning citizens of a heaven.
Furthermore the Institution propagates the divide between clergy and laity.
We have operated under the faulty notion that the Institution is necessary and remediable.
It is a circular rut that the Institution implements vicarious ministries which are only operable by a clergy (implying that there are _called_ among the "called").
Also, the spiritual gifts are not fully realizable in the Institution:
  Not all members will/can serve
  Gifts are feckless in a corporate faculty

There are four dogmatic Church orthopraxy: apostolic teaching, fellowship, commensality, and prayer
These are at best artificial in and, sadly, often absent from the Institution.

The hope in this research is to explore the issues involved in a mass believers' defection from the Institution.
Much of this research I need for myself and my family.
However, over the past several months I've been personally confronted with multiple families and individuals who are greatly disillusioned with the Institution.
But this is great point of hope, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer states: disillusionment with man's estate reminds us of our reality in Jesus Christ.

[TODO
This will be framed this as a sequence of investigations into the four elements of orthopraxy: didache, koinonia, commensality, and prayer.
Each of these will be explored in terms of what the Bible instructs concerning each and what their eternal purpose is (how they factor in the tabernacle).
