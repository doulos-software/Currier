Factual Acquaintance


Reading the Bible "in context" should not mean: "quote the whole passage".
It means that we must understand:
  1) the Bible was not written to us.
  2) we ought to discover the lifestyle, customs, and beliefs that shaped the people that the Bible was written to.
  3) we need to uncover the theology (i.e. doctrine) of the day.

Those means becoming acquainted with people long-dead based on evidence of their lives.
