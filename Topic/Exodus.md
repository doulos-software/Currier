[1Kgs 6:1]
~ the 4th year of Solomon's reign (966BC) is 480yrs post-Exodus = 1446BC

[Ex 12:40]
~ 430yrs
  2x215yrs

[Gen 15:13-16]
~ 400yrs capitivity

[Gal 3:17]
~ 430yrs - Paul reads this as a rough timeline

[Jdgs 11:26]

[1Chr 6:33-37]
~ 19 generations (i.e. 400ish years)


The controversy is basically:
- Literal (1446BC)
  - creates problems aligning with other Biblical dates
  - doesn't align w/ extra-Biblical material
  - doesn't align w/ the Bible's auto-interpretation (Paul, chronologies, etc.)
- Symbolic (1267BC)
  - times are rough or symbolic
  - 480 = 4 * 40 (40 being symbolic of a trial)
  - e.g. Jesus geneaologies are symbolic ~ 14+14+14+14



Re-Naming:
[Ps 78]
~ the fields of Zoan; with references to some of the plagues
! this is a usage of the the author's contemporary name for the city at the head of the Nile delta
  ...the city was not so-named in Exodus times
  
[Ex 1:11]
Symoblizers can align the Exodus w/ an actual Pharaoh named Ramses
Literalists must assume this is an emmendation
  ! why would they have chosen to rename this with an _earlier_ Pharaoh?!
