# Practical Theology

```
"If the Church was doing its job, we wouldn't need seminaries."
J.Anderson
```
Like it or not, this sentiment does express a Biblical concept of theological fulfillment.
Paul expresses that his letter are to be read aloud and dissemenated. [Col 4:16]
John expresses that the Holy Spirit teaches us through communion and convocation (group activities.) [1Jon 2:27]

More importantly, though, this paradigm seeks to reunite the theoretical with the actual.
Put another way: we ought to be developing the theology of all believers, no matter their starting point, because that is a necessary part of God's work.


## Practicality

If we assume that our current state is both important and deliberate (ramifications of God's love and sovreignty) then this state has meaning.
This meaning can be derived continuously formulating a personal theology.

One form of feedback that informs and grows our theology is the circumstantial world around us.
There is the empirical task of just observing and describing things.
There is the interpretive task of discerning the cause of things.
There is the intuitive task of optimizing things.
There is the assessment task of gauging and implementing a response.

Put another way (per Richard Osmer):
1. What is going on?
2. Why is this going on?
3. What ought to be going on?
4. How might we respond?
