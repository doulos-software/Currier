Interspecies breeding is prohibited - this may be extrapolated to spiritual species as well (i.e. Nephilim).

Milgram:
	Cherubim flanking the ark
	"Mixtures belong to the divine realm"
	Interbreeding violates God's distinctive modeling
	The curtain, walls, and garments in the Tabernacle were mixtures - and the belt of the priest; the civilian has a thread of blue in their white tassels.
	The greater the mixture ratio, the closer to the holiness
