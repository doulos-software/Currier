# Elder

The word elder refers to an older person - both now and in antiquity.
Life expectancy has greatly increased but that doesn't mean the age of ancient elders was less than it is now: just that there were far fewer of them.

Elder, as a role, refers to a community leader - carrying the implication of old age in the name.

Both 1Peter 5 & Numbers 11 imply a higher mean age among elders than the general Church population.

Biblically, an elder possesses the aforementioned traits as well as character traits laid out in [1Tim 3] & [Tts 1].
Most of those qualifications are straight forward but special attention must be paid to the condition of his wife and children.
These qualifications might be viewed as a winnowing of the crop of elderly into those fit for Church service.  [Num 11]

There is some wiggle room in terms of appointment but it must be consistent.
That consistency does not end with simply appointing the same brand of Elder over and over.
We must also be consistent with Church history.
Biblical leadership appointments were never given to youngsters.
It is interesting that, at Stephen's stoning, the Bible records that Saul was a "young man".  [Acts 7:58]
Brash young Jacob was put through the ringer whereas Israel, advanced in years, saw his providential appointment and "worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff."  [Gen 47:31] [Heb 11:21]

Further, the notion of appointment is not that we create rulers.
Rather, it is discovering them in our midst; alongside us.

A side-effect of old age is the advent of suffering, which is necessary for temperment.
The ability to gently, humbly rebuke another and weather the storms of controversy and backlash comes only from this temperment.
It is trite, but true, that you can only have decades of experience after decades of life.
