Bronze Serpent


[Num 21]
  One interesting thing here is that the Israelites six not yet have any codified scriptures when this event took place.
  They likely had the peak traditions but would not necessarily have made a soloist linkage between nachoushton and nachash of [Gen 3].

[John 3:14]
  Gives the ultimate type of the serpent but this would have been a mystery to the Mosaic Israelites.
