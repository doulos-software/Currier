Matthew Currier


The attempt of this repository is to skillfully divide Scripture and record study topics in a useful format that will motivate people to pursue God.

I have some other, non-Biblical, stuff [here](https://fingerskier.github.io/ajar/).

I believe in a personal God, the God of the Bible.
I believe that He speaks through His Word to us and the most salient points are revealed to us by His Spirit.
I believe that it is okay if there are things about Him that we don't fully understand but the essential things are knowable by all.
I believe that He is holy, good, and just: but also, thankfully, merciful and gracious.
I believe that we cannot stand in His presence in our natural state and that is a purposeful dilemma designed to draw us to ask, "Why?"

We stand on the shoulders of giants.
I want this repository to be a compilation of, hopefully, the best of the wealth of information which is freely available to us.
However, as Newton said, it's as if we stand on the shore and wonder at the pebbles while a whole ocean lay waiting...
