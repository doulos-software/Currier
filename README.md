Matthew Currier


The attempt of this repository is to skillfully combine Scripture, music, and mathematics into forms that motivate people to pursue God.  I am not particularly talented at any of the aforementioned...things;  but I am quite interested in them and am, by design, a unique, eclectic aggregation of ability.  I am what I am because He made me that way for His purposes.

I believe in a personal God, the God of the Bible.  I believe that He speaks through His Word to us and the most salient points are revealed to us.  I believe that it is okay if there are things about Him that we don't fully understand but the essential things are known to all.  I believe that He is holy, good, and just.  I believe that we cannot stand in His presence in our natural state and that is a purposeful dilemma designed to draw us to ask, "Why?"
