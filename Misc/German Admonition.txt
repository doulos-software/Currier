Thus speaketh Christ our Lord to us,
“You call Me master and obey Me not,
	You call Me light and see Me not,
	You call Me way and walk Me not,
	You call Me life and choose Me not,
	You call Me wise and follow Me not,
	You call Me fair and love Me not,
	You call Me rich and ask Me not,
	You call Me eternal and seek Me not,
	You call Me noble and serve Me not,
	You call Me gracious and trust Me not,
	You call Me might and honor Me not,
	You call Me just and fear Me not,
	If I condemn you…blame me not.”
