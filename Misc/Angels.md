Generally the term _angelos_ is used to denote these beings who inhabit the spiritual realm and are loyal to Yahweh.  The hebrew word for angel is _mal'akh_.

Interestingly: both _theos_ and _elohim_ are used to describe these same, created beings.
This term denotes a king rather than a role.
i.e. God inhabits the spiritual realm and is, thus, elohim; He is also **the** Elohim in that He is superior to the others.

[Ps 89:1]
[Ps 89:7]
[Ex 15:11]
