Paul's tirade against Christianity seems like a natural end of legalism.  Nebuchadnezzar's madness is the other.

There are two problems with the judaizer's assault on Paul:
	1. He was vastly more intellectually capable than they
	2. He had the truth on his side (it is not our job to defend the Spirit)

What is the sign of belief?
	Salvation <- Faith -> Fruit
	[Gal 6] - the fruit
	[Heb 13:7] - the right to inspect fruit

What is the relationship between the Law and the Trinity?
The condescension is inherent in the makeup of the Trinity.
What did it mean that Jesus fulfilled the Law?

Shall we live how we want?
If not, shall we then forcibly do good?
If so, are we no longer free?
