Leadership at War


We are in a spiritual war.
This requires a much more serious attitude than most Western Christians carry.
There are several virtues which denote a leader who _will be_ successful.


Humility
---------
Humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less.


Excellence
----------
Excellence is doing the very best within the circumstances you find yourself.


Vision and Mission
-------------------
An end goal is essential, as are milestones.
Strategy and tactics only work if a vision and mission exist.


Courage
-------
Courage is doing what's right under fire.
There is no opportunity for courage if there is no opposition.
It takes no courage to do something the easy (unethical) way.
