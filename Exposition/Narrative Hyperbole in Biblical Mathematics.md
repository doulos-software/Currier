Narrative Hyperbole in Biblical Mathematics


An analysis of numbers in the Bible reveals a theological encoding in dates, timespans, and ordinality.
Using modern, forensic techniques we can determine whether certain numbers are artificial or actual accountings.
Artificial numbers do not undermine the authority and infallibility of Scripture.
On the contrary, when the Bible is thus shown to be congruent with known patterns of thought in the ancient mind and superior in message it is all the more amazing.
