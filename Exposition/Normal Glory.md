Normal Glory
...the prevalence of relevance thinking and the evaporation of orthodoxyin the institutionalized Church...


What is normative in the Church (sacrificial giving, true reconciliation of people with their creator and each other, spiritual intimacy) is not normal in common society - and this is, likewise, true in the institutionalized Church.
Centuries of high church and culturally driven orthopraxy have divorced Church members from their reality as sojourning citizens of a heaven.
What should be the dogmatic practice of Church members: apostolic teaching, fellowship, commensality, and prayer; are at best artificial and, sadly, often absent.

My hope in this paper is to explore the issues involved in a mass believers' defection from the institutional Church.
Much of this research I need for myself and my family.
However, over the past several months I've been personally confronted with multiple families and individuals who are greatly disillusioned with the institutional Church.
But this is great point of hope, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer states: disillusionment with man's estate reminds us of who is really in charge - Jesus Christ.

I'm framing this as a sequence of investigations into the four elements of orthopraxy: didache, koinonia, commensality, and prayer.
Each of these will be explored in terms of what the Bible instructs concerning each and what their eternal purpose is (how they factor in the tabernacle).
