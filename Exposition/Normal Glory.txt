Normal Glory
cultural relevance and the evaporation of orthodoxy


What is normative in the Church (sacrificial giving, true reconciliation of people with their creator and each other, spiritual intimacy) is not normal in common society - and this is, likewise, true in the institutionalized Church.
Centuries of high church and culturally driven orthopraxy have divorced Church members from their reality as sojourning citizens of a heaven.
What should be the dogmatic practice of Church members: apostolic teaching, fellowship, commensality, and prayer; are at best artificial and, sadly, often absent.

My hope in those paper is to explore the issues involved in believers defection s from Church institutions.
Much of this research I need footer myself and family.
However, over the past several months I've been personally confronted with multiple families and individuals who are greatly disillusioned with the institutionalized Church.
But this is great point of hope, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer states: disillusionment with man's estate reminds us of who is really in charge - Jesus Christ.
