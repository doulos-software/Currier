# Vocation
~ a Latinized version of "calling", _vocatzio_
...the life that God has assigned to a Christian
...and to which they are called

"You have been saved, now you are free to be."  Jim Nestigan

[1Cor 7:17]
assigned ~ _emerisen_ = bestowed, a distribution
called ~ _keklyken_ = an announcement

[Eph 5]


## Sex

The preimmenent example of vocation:
	Within the institution of marriage Yahweh uses the act of sexual intercourse to create.
	When the act is aligned with the vocation of husband/wife/parent it is a good work; apart from the vocation it is a selfish, sinish act.

This Bibilical pattern applies to all roles and callings.


## Altars

[Rom 12:1]

Just as a person can have multiple vocations there are outlet for each:
- Office
- Mine
- Marriage bed
- Kitchen
- et cetera


## Service

The goal of Biblical vocation is service and love rather than self-interest.
Thus, we have an economic establishment: an interactive, self-supporting, rules-based culture.
