Separating bone from marrow
Wheat from chaff
Sheep from goats

God is always the one doing the dividing.
His divisions are personal or end-of-times.

[Acts 22:41]

God's current acts are about adding to and multiplying His church.


[John 10:10]
The enemy is about dividing now.


Unity does not mean that we have to think or act the same...but that we have the same purposes.
