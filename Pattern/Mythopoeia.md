Mythopoeia
## a narrative genre where an artificial mythology is created to serve the story
 

C.S. Lewis:
"The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact.
The old myth of the Dying God, without ceasing to be myth, comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history.
It happens—at a particular date, in a particular place, followed by definable historical consequences.
We pass from a Balder or an Osiris, dying nobody knows when or where, to a historical Person crucified (it is all in order) under Pontius Pilate.
By becoming fact it does not cease to be myth: that is the miracle.
...
God is more than god, not less: Christ is more than Balder, not less.
We must not be ashamed of the mythical radiance resting on our theology.
We must not be nervous about "parallels" and "pagan Christs": they ought to be there—it would be a stumbling block if they weren't.
We must not, in false spirituality, withhold our imaginative welcome.
If God chooses to be mythopoeic—and is not the sky itself a myth—shall we refuse to be mythopathic?"
