# Body Position

Here we are exploring the significance of body positioning in Bibilical text.
We'll look into variant forms, distinguish between states and actions, and dig for some meanings.


[Deut 6:7]
This passage is directing us on when to teach our children.
The gist is: all the time.
The way the Holy Spirit encapsulates life activity is by relating it to four actions: sitting, walking, lying, and rising.


## Sit

[Gen 27:19] "sit up and eat"
Can't/shouldn't eat lying down
Note also that he is commanding his fatehr

[Ex 18:14] "why do you sit alone?"
He alone, surrounded by people.
Sitting implies a retraction, almost a depressive act [submission?] as if physically succumbing to societal pressure (rather than wavering in his ethic).

[Num 32:6] "while you sit here"
Evil laziness: they sit while another goes to fight and die for them.

[Judg 4:5] "sit under the palm of Deborah"
Location does matter: she used the historical significance to give a message.

[Ruth 4:1-2] "sit down here"
Boaz is issuing a command to fellow rulera: an authoritative gesture.
This is also preparation for a legal proceeding - part of the scheme.

[Ps 1:1] "the seat of scoffers"
Interesting that sitting (ease) is the position of the scoffer.
The complainer is the idle one.

[Rev 3:21] "sit with me"
Sitting is our ultimate destination (and goal).


## Stand

[Ps 1:1] "the way of sinners"
Standing in sin is open defiance against the Creator.
Because it is active in the sense of not bneing a restful state;
But nothing is being accomplished - it is taking up space to prevent something else from occurring.
POF: believers do the same thing in opposition to the world - we fill a space that would otherwise be filled by evil or,worse, void.


## Walk

[Ps 1:1] "the counsel of the wicked"
It is quite a different matter to hear a thing than to do it.
Walking first requires standing, then a direction (hopefully a destination but not always.)
The danger of many occultic practices is that they can be done in the heart, requiring nearly no effort.


## Run

Prostrate

Bow

Kneel

Lift

Stretch
