# Rewards

It is common refrain in the modern church that we some believers are given _extra_ rewards because of good works.
This is a flawed, divisive interpretation that depends on a set of non-biblical presuppositions.
The goal of this article is to expose how our presuppositions constrain us to a faulty interpretation.


[Mark 10:29-30]()
  There is no indication in this passage that Jesus is speaking of demarcations within the Church (i.e. the demographic of all loyal believers.)
  Jesus points are:
  1. Loyal believers are destined for improved circumstances (i.e. new earth, i.e. God's presence)
  2. There will be a reversal of how things are.
  
  If you assume that Jesus is only referencing believers then you induce a division among them.
  However, there is no reason to presume that narrowing of scope: Jesus' _many_ may well refer to humans in general.
  In this case, then, of course many who suffer now will sit with Jesus while many powerful will suffer.

[2Cor 5:10]()
  This is similar to the prior passage: the interpretation hinges on who "we...all" refers to.
  If it refers only to the Church then we induce a further division beyond salvation.
  Otherwise, we can accept the saved/not-saved grouping that God has already established.

[1Cor 3:8]()
  This passage speaks of rewards in the same vein as [Matt 6:20]().
  The thrust here is what "treasures" we can take with us.
  It clearly says that some treasures _remain_ of the day of fire (while some are disintegrated.)
  From prior verses it could easily be said that this _remaining work_ upon resurrection is family members that we had a hand in adopting.

[Rev 2:23]()
  "I will give to each on of you according to your deeds."
  First, there is no deed of ours that can influence or salvation; therefore, this passage is not speaking of salvation.
  Jesus says that the _reward_ for Jezebel [and her children] is deadly disease.
  So, the promise of a gift for the believer can be said to be life.

[Rev 22:12]()
  Jesus is bringing a reward with Him to repay humans' deeds.
  Again, if we presume that His coming is only to the Church then we induce a division.
  However, we know that Jesus is coming _to Earth_, thus, to those who live on Earth; i.e. **humans**.
  This is a summation of the gospel: believer/non-believer; as opposed to the previous interpretation which is a special coming to others.


The common flaw adjacent to this issue is presumption.
In order to glean an interpretation of post-resurrection divisions we must presume a caste system.
It is clearly possible to interpret these passages without that division.
Furthermore, inducing those divisions is detrimental to our kingdom work.
It is also antithetical to the greater biblical narrative of God expanding His family to say that there will be further divisions imposed.

This line of thought also presumes that there are different levels of closeness to God.
We know this is true on earth...but there is no reason to assume that it will be so after the resurrection.


It's illuminating to examine the rewards outline by Christ in Rev 2-3:

| locale | deed | reward |
| Ephesus | endurance | eats from the tree of life |
| Smyrna | faithfulness | no 2nd death |
| Pergamum | repentance | hidden manna, white stone |
| Thyatira | reject false-teachers | authority, morning star |
| Sardis | strengthening | dressed in white, name in the book of life |
| Philadelphia | kept the word | made a pillar |
| Laodicea | zealotry | sit with Abba |

There are no levels of believers illucidated in this passage.
The only division is believer/non-believer.
