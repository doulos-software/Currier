Bible Structure

Why the prevalence of 6s in the Bible's structure?  6 is...?the number of man?

What is the significance of 2383?  is the number of words given below accurate?

If the chaper/verse numberings are not inspired, then why are there so many patterns therein?

	Theory 1: (mine) because the underlying text is inspired of the greatest being, and we are designed to perceive and understand patterns, we naturally see these patterns in His work.

	Theory 2: (mine) the Scripture is structured in such a high-level way that any arrangement of it evokes patterns.

Note: there are some OT books that are divided differently by the Jews.

Why are there patterns in the Bible?
	1) God is proving His sovreignty by installing patterns within and between books that could not have been done by man.
	2) Proverbs 25:2
	3) It makes the Bible a self-verifying entity (an infinite designer would imbue infinite complexity within infinite elegance)

66 Books
	66 = 2 x 3 x 11	(67,61)

	39 OT
		39 = 3 x 13 (41,37)

	27 NT
		27 = 3 x 3 x 3 (29,23)

Total Verses = 31102 = 23145 OT + 7957 NT
	31102 = 15551 * 2
	23145 = 1543 * 5 * 3
	7957 = 109 * 73

Total Chapters = 1188 (middle verse = 118:8)
	1193 is prime (+5)
	1188 = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 11 
	1187 is prime (-1)

Number of Heberew Words = 8674
	8677 is prime (+3)
	8674 = 2 x 4337
	8669 is prime (-5)

Number of Greek Words = 5624
	5639 is prime (+15)
	5624 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 19 x 37
	5623 is prime (-1)

Total Words = 14298
	14303 is prime (+5)
	14298 = 2383 x 3 x 2 (prime factors)
	14293 is prime (-5)
	that's not a coincidence
