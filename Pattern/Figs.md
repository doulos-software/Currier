Figs


[Matt 21]
	no fruit _among the leaves_
	instant, dramatic withering

[Luke 13:6-9]
	why a fig tree in a vineyard?
	the Master seeks fruit
	3yrs?
	the servant tarried the Lord 1yr more

[Matt 24]
	_until these things_
		perhaps means that all these things occur within a single generation

[Mark 11]


[Jdg 9:11]

[Jer 24]

[Is 5]

[Ps 80]
