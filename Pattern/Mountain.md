The physical mountains were the abode of the Gods.
  i.e. Mount Hermon was where the watchers descended to Earth on their rebellion ~ "The Gates of Hell"
  [Matt 16:18] Jesus was standing at that place when he made this declaration

Rhetorical mountains are kingdom authorities.
[Matt 17:20] this phrasing deliberately engages the Gates of Hell, the Mount of Transfiguration, and the local authorities (they would've been overlooking Herod's Temple in Ceasarea Phillipi) as _mountains_.
