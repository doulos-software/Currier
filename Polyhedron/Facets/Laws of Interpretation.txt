Laws of Interpretation

	The Golden Rule
		WHEN THE PLAIN SENSE MAKES COMMON SENSE MAKE NO OTHER SENSE!
			traditionalists say SEEK no other sense, there is not harm in seeking as long as we A) honor the Word and B) take the plain meaning as primary
		primary, literal, ordinary
			'secondary' importance is implied for other levels of interpretation
		rationalism
		context vs. pretext (beware the eisigesis)
	Expositional Constancy
		= the number of recurrances of an idea is important
		the Holy Spirit will use the same idioms over and over via different authors and different forms of speech
	First Mention
		= the first mention of a thing has special significance
		'things' often develop from simple to complex (or vice versa)
		idealogical coloring
	Gap Principle
		i.e. an incomplete list which parallels an "older" list ~ it's missing element is important
		e.g. Acts 7
			Israel blew it, made it up, blew it, made it up, blew it...then Stephen is cut off - what's due next?!
	The Stereo Law
		an identical mention of a thing in another context has special significance
		Luke 4:18-19 ~ Isaiah 61 (He stops at a comma, what's next?)
	Structural Integrity
		the Bible pre-answers [divisive] heresies before they are invented
		John 1:1
		John 12 ()
	Recurrence
		important ideas are scattered throughout (spread spectrum :)
	Dichotomies
		hetero-?
		many Biblical ideas are forehead-slappers
			many of these involve an understanding of time/space that we cannot have
		election vs. calling
		trinity
	Cardinality
		the order in which items appear in a list are important
		I'm not prepared to comment on the order in which things appear between the Bible books because they are typically in neither chronological nor their original order (the order is not inspired)
