Introduction
	Bibliology = knowledge of "the book"
		"The Bible is not a book man could write if he would, nor is it a book man would write if he could."  Lewis Sperry Chafer
	
	The deutero-Isaiah hypothesis
		invented in the late 18th century
		claims that Isaiah has multiple authors
			chapters 1-39
			chapters +
		Jesus disproves this
			John 12:38
				Isaiah said
				= Is 53:1
			John 12:40
				'again' Isaiah said
				= Is 6:10
	Coincidentally
		we now have 39 chapters OT, 27 NT
		but chapter/verse not added until 15th century

		accurate = carefully prepared
		Unbreakable
			Is 40:8
			Jn 10:35
