Canonicity

two approaches
	Historical
		God determined the canon ~ not out responsibility
		OT canon finalized by B.C. 250
		NT canon finalization
			Muratorian Canon A.D. 170
				all but Hebrews, James, & 3 John
			current 27 book adopted by Council of Laodicea in A.D.  363
			the 27 affirmed by Council of Hippo A.D. 393
			the 27 affirmed by Council of Carthage A.D. 397
			Criteria
				apostolic authorship (only possible exceptions: James & Hebrews)
				ecclesiastical acceptance
				expositional constancy
				orthodoxy
	Circular
		1 Timothy 5:18
			1st ref = Deut 25:4
			2nd ref = Luke 10:7
			...both referred to as Scripture
		2 Timothy 3:16
			θεοπνευστος = God-breathed
		2 Peter 1:16-21
			16) penned by eyewitnesses (both NT & OT)
				Daniel 4
			17-18) apostles eyewitnessed the canonization inauguration
			19) NT confirms OT
			20) Scriptures' origin
			21) prophecy ~ men carried by God
		2 Peter 3
			15) emphasis on Paul's γραφει as Scriptural
			16) equates Paul's γραφει with "other Scriptures"
		Circulation of Scriptures
			Col 4:16
			1 Thess 5:27
