2 Timothy 2

1-2) Our fingerprints on the future
[2Kgs 20:19]

2) entrust ~ parathema: the implication is to come alongside with the mythos
"faithful men who are able to teach others"

24) don't start fights
  we're not called just to endure annoyances...but _evil_


26) they _may_ come to their senses...but they may not...but we _must_ persevere
