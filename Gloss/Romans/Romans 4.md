# Romans 4


1) Through the flesh Abraham gained wealth and prestige...but only because God allowed it.

2) Abraham had no cause to boast of before God.

3) Abraham's belief culminates in righteousness...by God's work. 

4) The one who works ~ earns his wage.
Does God promise us wages?
  [Rom 6:23]
  [Prov 11:18]
  [Zech 11:12] ~ the slave price 
  [Luke 10:7]
  

5) The one who doesn't work ~ if he believes, attaining faith, he is righteous.
Ungodly = the absolute worst of sinners.
..yet still redeemable by Christ.


9-10) Abraham was counted as righteous [Gen 15] before his circumcision [Gen 17:10+]
