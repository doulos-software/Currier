Romans 6


1) Is it okay to break the speed limit if you can afford the fine?  No.
The act is still wrong even if we can (or think we can) withstand the judgment.


6) God wants to kill you
...He isn't as concerned with the soon you struggle with as He is with the ones you aren't struggling with
~= freedom...life


12) 'let' sin reign (implies a voluntary allowance (or not))
_topos_ ~ a dwelling place
