Romans 13

Yahweh isn't instituting a governmental system nor condoning one.
He is simply instructing on how to live within their system.

1-4) civil governmental authority is given by God

3-4) We are not required to submit to any government but we must be cognoscent of the ramifications


8-10) there is something greater that ought to drive governance


14) "put on The Lord Jesus Christ":
Lord/Kyrion ~ kingship
Jesus ~ humanity
Christ ~ messianic
