Romans 8


28) all things work together
 the culmination of events is good
 the good worked by God is for His children;
 ~ we can, thus, surmise that does not work evil for outsiders but He leaves them to the consequences of their actions

29) foreknown
    predestined (pre what?  pre-us)
	  to be conformed
30) called
    justified
	glorified
