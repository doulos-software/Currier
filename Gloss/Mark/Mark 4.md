# Mark 4


12) Do they not want forgiveness?  Or does God not want to forgive, in order to save even more?
	[Is 6:9-10]
	[Acts 28:26]
	[Rom 11:8]


15) _immediately_ ~ Satanic minions are always at hand

The Sower ~ [John 20:21]
	The imagery of the two seas in Israel is telling: The Galilee is a provider and a source of life, The Dead Sea endlessly receives and outputs nothing.

32) birds are Satanic minions


One of these boats was discovered in modern times and was 26' x 7'.

35) Jesus prompted them to go, knowing a storm would come - can He be trusted?  Yes.

36) They left the crowd.
Jesus took them, "just as He was".
_Other boats_ ~ what happened to these other boats?


38) Some of them were professional fishermen - and they were afraid...but Jesus was not.  Things indicates that the storm was supernaturally crazy.
Jesus had to be roused.

39) Jesus muzzled the storm.  He used exorcism language against the storm.

40) Their lack of faith was forgetting/ignoring that Jesus had told them to cross the lake.
Their lack of seeing possibilities: maybe they were desperate for a new method or course; but He simply removed the obstacle.

Part of this exercise was to prepare the disciples for the upcoming encounter with Legion.
