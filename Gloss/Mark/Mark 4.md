# Mark 4


12) Do they not want forgiveness?  Or does God not want to forgive, in order to save even more?
	[Is 6:9-10]
	[Acts 28:26]
	[Rom 11:8]


15) _immediately_ ~ Satanic minions are always at hand

The Sower ~ [John 20:21]
	The imagery of the two seas in Israel is telling: The Galilee is a provider and a source of life, The Dead Sea endlessly receives and outputs nothing.

32) birds are Satanic minions
