# Mark 4


12) Do they not want forgiveness?  Or does God not want to forgive, in order to save even more?
	[Is 6:9-10]
	[Acts 28:26]
	[Rom 11:8]


15) _immediately_ ~ Satanic minions are always at hand

The Sower ~ [John 20:21]

32) birds are Satanic minions


One of these boats was discovered in modern times and was 26' x 7'.

35) Jesus prompted them to go, knowing a storm would come - can He be trusted?  Yes.

36) They left the crowd.
Jesus took them, "just as He was".
_Other boats_ ~ what happened to these other boats?


38) Some of them were professional fishermen - and they were afraid...but Jesus was not.

39) Jesus muzzled the storm.
