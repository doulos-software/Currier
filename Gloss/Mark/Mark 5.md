# Mark 5


The Incurables

The decapolis (ten "cities") whose swine herds served the gentile populace.


These unclean spirits had to have Jesus permission to change venue.
However, the unregenerated are able to be captured by them: [2Tim 2:26]

The demoniac needed recreation, not reformation.


30) Who touched my garments?
Jesus calls for the woman's testimony.


34) _Daughter_ ~ what a pronouncement!
A child of God at a single touch...


39)
No soul-sleep:
	[Php 1:20]
	[Jam 2:26]


42) Why the parenthetical note about her age?
Note that the girl and the woman's ailment were the same age.
- On the way to heal the Jew Jesus healed the 
Gentile
