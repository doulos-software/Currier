Mark 9


32) they were afraid to ask - afraid He was being literal, afraid of breaking out of their paradigm

33) an inappropriate, ill-timed argument

34) ...the bragging fishermen
  They had the prestige of being hand-picked

35) the formula for success
  {Matt 5:19} the role of the law in success
  {Matt 25:21}
  {Matt 19:27+}
  Jesus does not discount or dampen their desire for greatness
  
  {1Pet 5:5-6} in God's timing
  
36) {Luke 22:26}
  1st century children had the lowest status

37) the association mapped out by God
