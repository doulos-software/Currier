Mark 9


1) What is the kingdom then?  The power of the earth cracking, veil rending, and resurrection and ascension?

2) transfigured ~ [Rom 12:1-2] [John 17:23+]


4) Moses and Elijah ~ the Law and the Prophets; but in reverese order.


21-25) Yahweh gives belief; it is not an intellectual or spiritual things but tangible, physical

22) "if"?  The father is honest and transparent.

23) This is not belief in oneself but belief in God and His purposes.

24) Again, the father is painfully honest.
[Matt] says the father was on his knees
[Luke] says this was the father's only child


32) they were afraid to ask - afraid He was being literal, afraid of breaking out of their paradigm

33) an inappropriate, ill-timed argument

34) ...the bragging fishermen
  They had the prestige of being hand-picked

35) the formula for success
  {Matt 5:19} the role of the law in success
  {Matt 25:21}
  {Matt 19:27+}
  Jesus does not discount or dampen their desire for greatness - He is pointing out that their idea of greatness is flawed; greatness is servanthood, the way to servanthood is to server
  
  {1Pet 5:5-6} in God's timing
  
36) {Luke 22:26}
  1st century children had the lowest status

37) the association mapped out by God
