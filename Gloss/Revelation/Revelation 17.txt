Revelation 17


The 7 are kingdoms in succession
	#6 was Rome
The 10 are concurrent nations/kingdoms

2) sexual immorality with the _kings of the earth_

4) the seductress


6) _drunk with blood_ exactly parallels the blood-drinking cannibal giants of The Book of Enoch

7)	the angel spoke
	...don't marvel (explanation forthcoming)
		explaining
			the mystery of the woman
			the mystery of the beast w/ 7 heads, 10 horns
	Rev 13, Dan 7
8)	the beast
		existed, but not now
		about to rise from the bottomless pit
		about to goto the destruction
	earth-dwellers who are not sealed/saved
	...marvel to see the beast
		_because_ it existed, but not now, ?but they knew it was coming?
	the implication is that the saved were known "from the foundation of the world"
9)	"calls for...wisdom"
	7 heads = 7 mountains
		mountains are types of kingdoms
		...so, probably not Rome in the end but an homage to the Roman-beastly heritage
		...v.10) 5 are fallen (means five prior kingdoms)
		the woman is seated on the 7
10)	7 kings
		5 "fallen" (dead)

		1 existing
		1 TBD
11)	beast (existed but not now)
		an 8th belonging to the 7
			8th ~ horn; 7th ~ mountain/kingdom
		...and it goes to destruction
12)	10 horns = 10 kigns
	...have not yet received royal power
	...will receive authority for 1 hour
		together with the beast
		1hr idiomatic of ???
13)	all kings are single-minded (i.e. against God)
	willingly give their authority to the beast
14)	the kings make war on the Lamb
	...the Lamb conquers them
		for He is Lord of lords/King of kings
		those with Him are chosen & faithful
