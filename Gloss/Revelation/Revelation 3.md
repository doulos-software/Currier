# Revelation 3


12)
"write on him the name of my God" this is a common monikerby which Yahweh marks his people.
...I wonder if our spiritual dimension is marked in a way that is visible to elohim.


21) The conqueror will sit "**with me on My throne**"!
That is amazing...clearly we are not unified with Him or supplanting Him but working alongside.
Caveat: for the overcomer
