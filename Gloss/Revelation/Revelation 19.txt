Revelation 19


9)	a command from an angel ('the' angel?)
	"Write this"
		Word delivered via messenger
		1. Blessed are the invitees
		2. the true words of God

10)	Even in his wizened christianity John mistakes the situation.
	the angel is faithful :)
	a _fellow_ servant
		with John
		with his brothers (who hold to the testimony of Jesus)
	an angelic redirection: Worship God
	The purpose of all Scripture:
		The testimony of Jesus is _the spirit of prophecy_
		all Scripture is prophetic
		[Ps 119]
