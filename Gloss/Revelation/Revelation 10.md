# Revelation 10

These events come between the 6th and 7th trumpets.


4) John is not to concern himself with the doings, he is to concern himself with the scroll.  Like Elijah we must heed the still, small voice...the ordinary business of life.


8) the angel straddles sea & land like a link from humanity to the kingdom

9) Ez 2:8+

10) like the word it is satisfying and painful

11) the calling: consume the word, then proclaim it
