# Revelation 21

"pure gold, like clear glass"
...interestingly, gold takes on a bright, almost white appearance with a high silver content.
...the implication is the glory imbued with the blood in significant amounts. 

2) New Jerusalem ~= bride?  Does that mean a physical instantiation of connected believing humanity (per [1Cor 3:16])?

22) "no temple", Yahweh _is_ the temple.  As in v.2 ... the Church is transformed?
