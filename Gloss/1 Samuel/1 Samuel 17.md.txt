# 1 Samuel 17

4-7) Goliath was both a physical and a technological marvel.

4) Champion ~ a'sh_hbnim, the man between the two


8) "Am I not a Philistine?". Am I not your and your God's enemy?

37) David begins by understanding Yahweh's setup; he ends with a natural conclusion based on the circumstances _created by Yahweh_.
David understands and receives God's faithfulness through grace - progressive growth [Eph 2:8].

38) Perhaps Saul thought to gain recognition by having his armour visible; perhaps he truly thought he was helping David; perhaps he just didn't know better.  Perhaps it was all of these.


51) David used the enemy's weapon against him.
