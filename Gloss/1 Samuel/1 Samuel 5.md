1 Samuel 5


Dagon twice submitted:
v.3 ~ fallen face down; "they put him back in his place"
v.4-7 ~ headless and handless; they no longer tread in Dagon's space; they cast out Yahweh's ark.
God is doing to Dagon as his warriors did to their fallen opponents.

5-6) Ashdod means effusion or theft.

5) "to this day" which is when?  Probably into David's day.

6) "the hand of the LORD"...but Dagon had no hands.


8) they did not attempt to destroy the ark
They took the ark to Gath [Wine-Press].

They have now rejected the ultimate God as well as the insufficient god.
...and are left with themselves.
