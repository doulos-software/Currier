# 1 Samuel 24


1) Author gloss over the details of the battle with the Philistines to keep us focused on the Saul/David dynamic.


3) relieve himself
...Saul is vulnerable
...literal translation is "cover his feet"

4) David's men are interpreting mystical, providential events toward their desire.  They are not quoting words of Yahweh.


8) 
bowed - David responds from his strong position with humility.
