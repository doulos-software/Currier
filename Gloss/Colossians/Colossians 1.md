# Colossians 1


16) [Eph 6:12]


18) "firstborn" in the sense of stature; literally in the sense the He raised of His own volition and power.


24) what could be lacking?  This word is 'hysterema' which a sense of poverty - it is what we lack being those who 'have not seen and yet believe'; it is as in [Php 2:30] where the living synecdoche suffers as an exemplar.
