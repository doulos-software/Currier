# Colossians 3

9-14) The Church is made up of people deliberately brought in by God; there are no outsiders.

12) chosen ~ as in _elected_ by the Godhead
holy ~ meaning _set apart_ for good works
beloved ~ God lavishes His love on us as a testimony to others


15) And ~ such an important word: it shows us that this is a continuing thought, content before this is about the Church

16) Let ~ this is a deliberate openness on our part - allowing the Word in
...not just anything but the real truth
teaching & admonishing ~ we need to learn and keep each other in check **by sharing the word**
one another ~ perhaps the most piece of this verse: the intent is building the body, not performance or entertainment
"in all wisdom" ~ this a call to deal with each other deliberately carefully; perhaps the fruit of the Spirit [Gal 6] ought to be obvious in these dealings.
Psalms ~ songs of Biblical content
Hymns ~ rhetorical, metric literature
Spiritual Songs ~ these are pneumatic songs
