Philippians 2


"Your are far worse than you could ever imagine;  You are far more loved than you could ever perceive"

3) This is the antidote for selfishness and and unloving heart: "count other more significant than yourselves"
This begins the greatest testimony: that Christ did this.  He is greater than all yet was humbled more than all.


5-11) _this mind_ is available via Christ
Christ did not seek after superiority but sought humility.
