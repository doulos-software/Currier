# Daniel 5

God is in Babylon.

God has a plan for humility
...and it necessarily begins before the act that humbles
...i.e. there are many historical events leading up to Grand providential acts

as Belshazzar and Daniel were interacting the Persians were busily damming the river to enter Babylon under the city walls
