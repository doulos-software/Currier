# Daniel 3

14-15) Note the Nebbie asks a question but doesn't wait for an answer.

15) the worldy "but if you do not"


18) the imagers' reply "but if not".
This is not a worldly perspective.
They are answering the old call, "what if?"

What if your God doesn't exist?
Well, even so - this life of contrition is better then your hollow worship and we will not participate.
