Daniel 2

31-35) a great image = might, exceedingly bright, frightening
	head = fine gold
		glorious
		not stained
	chest/arms = silver
		blood
	middle = bronze
		judgment
	legs = iron
		war, power
	feet = iron/clay

	stone cut out (not by a human)
		struck the feet
		broke the feet into pieces
		...did the image collapse then?
		...like chaff = dust ~ carried away
			no trace was left
		It became a great mountain ~ filled the earth

	the metals
		...increase in strength ~ expanse
		...decrease in value ~ character

36) "and" Daniel was provided the dream and the interpretation by God
37) chutzpah
	acknowledging the King's stewardship
		kingdom
		power
		strength
		glory
38) wheresoever men dwell (h'aretz)
	beasts and fowls given to the king
	...for rule
	Nebuchadnezzar is the head of gold
39) 2nd kingdom, inferior
	3rd kingdom, brass
		ruled the earth
40) 4th kingdom, iron
	"strong as" iron
	iron breaks and subdues all things
		including all "these" things (other kingdoms? types of kingdoms?)
	in the same way it will break and bruise/crush
		Gen 3:15
41) feet and toes
	potters clay = Jer 17 (God the potter)
	...and iron = power/war
	divided kingdom (part godly? part worldly?)
