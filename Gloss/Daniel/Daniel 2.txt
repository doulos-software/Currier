# Daniel 2

A whole class of people are redeemed through Daniels faithfulness.


31-35) a great image = might, exceedingly bright, frightening
	head = fine gold
		glorious
		not stained
	chest/arms = silver
		blood
	middle = bronze
		judgment
	legs = iron
		war, power
	feet = iron/clay

	stone cut out (not by a human)
		struck the feet
		broke the feet into pieces
		...did the image collapse then?
		...like chaff = dust ~ carried away
			no trace was left
		It became a great mountain ~ filled the earth

	the metals
		...increase in strength ~ expanse
		...decrease in value ~ character

36) "and" Daniel was provided the dream and the interpretation by God
37) chutzpah
	acknowledging the King's stewardship
		kingdom
		power
		strength
		glory
38) wheresoever men dwell (h'aretz)
	beasts and fowls given to the king
	...for rule
	Nebuchadnezzar is the head of gold
39) 2nd kingdom, inferior
	3rd kingdom, brass
		ruled the earth
40) 4th kingdom, iron
	"strong as" iron
	iron breaks and subdues all things
		including all "these" things (other kingdoms? types of kingdoms?)
	in the same way it will break and bruise/crush
		Gen 3:15
	The United Stage
41) feet and toes
	potters clay = Jer 17 (God the potter)
	...and iron = power/war
	divided kingdom (part godly? part worldly?)
		but still with iron's strength
	Two Division Stage
42-43) The Ten Division Stage
42) the toes "of" the feet
	...partly iron, partly clay
		each toe mixed? or each one different?
	a kingdom partly strong, partly brittle
43)	"you saw", that being Nebuchadnezzar
		he saw the mixture and the mixing
	marriage of the clay and iron
		ceremonially married
		passionate union
		later broken
		the two don't mix, interestingly: a clay coating was used in ancient swordmaking to heat-cure steel
44-45) The Jewish Kingdom
44)	those kings, in all of their days (throughout time)
		His kingdom is setup
		...and cannot be destroyed
		...not inheritable
	this kingdom breaks the human kingdoms in pieces
	...and ends them
	...and stands forever
45)	the stone
		cut from a mountain
		cut by no human hand
			?implying it was cut divinely? or never needed cutting?
	"just as" this stone, so goes His kingdom
		implying the work of the stone is as the work of the Kingdom?
		it shattered the
		...iron - crushing strength
		...bronze - judgment
		...clay - fleshly frailness
		...silver - blood, redemption
		...gold - kingship, glory
		5 things ~ grace to all
	"a" great god, one who does things no man-made god can do
		this great god impressed Daniel and convinced him that the dream revelation and it's interpretation were sure
