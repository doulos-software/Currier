Daniel 9


[Jer 29:10-11] is the 70 years

1) Darius 1
	Darius the Mede ben Ahasuerus
	~ _made_ king (by whom?)
2) Darius 1
	I, Daniel (self authenticated, [Matt 24:15])
	perceived (studied) "in the books"
	A) the prophesied timespan
	B) the prophet's given authority
	C) the prophet's source (Yahweh)
	D) must pass...faith in the covenenter
	E) desolations = razing of Jerusalem & Temple
	F) 70 years
3) Daniel turned _his_ face to Elohim Addonai
	sought Him via prayer ~ προχιμαι
	pleas for mercy
	...with fasting (blooflow to the brain)
	...sackcloth (lacking vanity)
	...ashes (putting aside the worldly)
4) prayed to Yahweh Elohim, a confession
	Addonai
		great
		awesome Elohim
		covenanter
		steadfast lover
			of those that love Him and keep His commandments
5) iniquity (in escalating order)
	= sin (missing the mark)
	= wrongdoing
	= wickedness (not premeditated)
	= rebellion (premeditated)
6) it is sinful to disregard Biblical prophecy
	prophets spoke from God
	prophets spoke to kings, princes, fathers, and people
		of ?the? land
7) God vs. Man; righteousness vs. open shame
	inhabitants of:
		Judah
		Jerusalem
		Israel
		near
		far
	God drove them away
	~ because of their treachery = rebellion, against God
8) WE own open shame (recognizing Yahweh)
	kings
	princes
	father
9) GOD owns:
	mercy
	forgiveness
	_for_ we are rebels (allowing us recognize Him)
10) we have not obeyed:
		'walking' in His laws
			wading in the water
			...as opposed to [Rev 4:5]
		...these He set before us
			by priests and prophets
				priests stand with their backs to the people and their face to God
				prophets stand with the backs to God and their face to the people
11) all of the Prevailers With God have
		broken the law
		turned aside (from the path)
		refused to obey _His voice_
		...not Word...
	validates the Law because ~ promised curses
		"us"
		sinned against Him [Ps 51:4]
12) God confirms His Word
		spoken against "us" (as sinners)
		against "our" rulers
			"ruled" ~ past tense
		bringing (His active intervention)
		...great ער
		...the worst tragedy ever (up to that point)
13) even after this ער "we" didn't seek Him
		neither turned from iniquity
		neither gained His insight
14) הוהי has reserverd the ער for "us"
	because
		1) םהןלא הוהי is righteous in every way
		2) we have not obeyed
15) םהןלא ינדא
		brought His people out of Anguish, mightily
		made a name for Hisself
16) ינדא turn away Your wrath now that Jerusalem is publically shamed

18b) The appropriate approach to God.
