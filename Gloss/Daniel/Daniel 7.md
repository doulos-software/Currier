Puns & Multiple Interpretation

Four Winds
- God's natural sovereignty purveyors
- wind on Sea of Galilee, winds held back in Revelation
- [Eph 2:2] [Job 1:19]

Seas
- Mediterranean Sea bordered all these kingdoms
- [Rev 17:15] peoples, multitudes, nations, & tongues

Beasts
- empires
- previous visions emphasized continuity; this one emphasizes differences
1. Lion/Eagle ~ Babylon
	~ regal (top of the food-chain)
2. Bear ~ Persian
3. Winged Leopard ~ Greece
	4 wings
	4 heads - Greek empire was handed over to 4 top generals (Ptolemy took Palestine)
	3 ribs; 3 major victories; Babylon, Eygpt, Lydia
[Hos 13:5+] [Rev 13:1]
4. Beast
	"iron" teeth (linked to prior vision ~ toes)
	Greece nor Rome were "conquered" but morelike crumbled
	10 horns 
	- [Dan 2:44] ~ "all these kingdoms" = 10 toes
	- [Rev 17:3] ~ 10 horns (beast written by whore)

Horns
- symbolic of Kings
- also represents the King's rolling entourage

Little Horn
- amongst the 10 horns, inconspicuous
- "antichrist" is a state-of-being, not a person; this is a coming leader
