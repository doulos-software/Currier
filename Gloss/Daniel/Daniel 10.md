# Daniel 10

Interesting that God waits til Daniel is around 90 to give the climactic vision; akin to John who a similar age on Patmos when the Revelation was given.


1) the vision was understandable to Daniel _and_ he understood it

2-3,12-13) Why are the timespans conincident and equal extent?
	We may take an implication that we are led to fast coincident with greater spiritual warfare (alongside the angels)


5) A man, _the_ man
clothed in linen ~ a human spirit
belt ~ [Is :], [Eph 6:] = truth/faith that binds righteousness to us
...of gold ~ pure and holy

6) the man has an appearance of destructiveness
Beryl = yellow quartz
he has a powerful voice

7) his compatriots could not see the vision but they sensed it

8) in the presence of God Daniel's get was turned to rain


13) Nations each have a spiritual overseer
[Col 1:16]


16) whoever this is is in human form
...perhaps not the same one as before, likely Gabriel, the Messianic messenger

16-18) when Daniel's strength was completely wasted God [alone] could strengthen him

19) Daniel needed God's strength too receive God's message
...[Eph 2:8-9]


21) "what is inscribed" ~ it is already written
