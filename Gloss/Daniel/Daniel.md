Daniel (27)


Authorship dates for range from 6th to 2nd century B.C.
Arguments for the late date (that are most viable) are that the book fits later apocalyptic genre very well.
The book uses vocabulary and language features dating from the 6th century.
If we take Jesus' word that A) Daniel was a prophet and B) there are predictive prophecies in his book (e.g. abomindation of desolation) then neither view is problematic.
e.g. There are predictions in chapter 11 which are yet future.
If the book was written later it does not preclude the fact that the prophet lived and worked earlier.
To a certain extent we see this in every book of the Bible because they were not magically transcribed as is - rather they were carefully compiled and edited by faithful scholars.
Furthermore, Daniel is not the only prophet to receive revelation regarding the kingdoms of the east.
