Joel 2


16) the bride leaves her chamber...when?


25-27) can we Christians claim this promise?  We certainly can: {Rom 3} {John 17}

25) Even a trashed life can be redeemed - given an extension, so to speak
  The devourer:
    Eats ~ 
    Hops ~ 
    Destroys ~ 
    Militarizes ~ 
    Sent by Yahweh ~ 
  Also refers to {Joel 1:4} predicting the undoing of the devastation
    
26) The redeemed:
  Not just eat but be satisfied
  Praise the name of Yahweh
  Remember His works
  Are not 'put to shame' ~ made ashamed, embarrassed, eclipsed
  
27) Israel is an example for all believers
  
  
  
28) {Acts 2:17}
