# James 1

4) The fact that endurance effects us implies a long-term scenario.
It is implied that we can opt-out of this process (and lose the benefit.)
"mature and complete" while we can expect progress, ultimate maturity and completeness


9-11) gospel perspective


12) Here we also see the tenses of salvation:
- been saved: the loved one, held by God
- being saved: steadfastness
- be saved: crown of life

It is not "Christian"to simply endure temptations and trial


18) we ought to be childlike, rather than childish, in our approach to Yahweh


27) "unstained"? not changed/altered by worldliness
"whatever you do to the least of these" [Matt 25:40]
