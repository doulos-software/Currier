James 4

2) "Kill"?  This is a profound evil among any group, especially the church.
[Matt 5:22]
[1Jhn 3:15]


5) Perhaps not a quotation, because it <ahem> does not with any OT passage:
	"Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture _speaks_?  He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us."

17) It is such a fine line between the evil of murder in the heart and not doing a good, necessary thing.
"The right thing" is that which the LORD wills [v.15]
