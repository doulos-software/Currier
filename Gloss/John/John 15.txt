John 15

The sections here, delineated by "these things I have told you"


Properties of fruit bearing ministries
	A. the branch must maintain a connection to Christ in order to bear fruit
	B. unfruitful branches are cut-off
	C. recently cut-off branches can still grow for a short time
	D. {Gal 6}


1) The members of the Trinity have distinctive roles

2) Being pruned is better than being than being taken away
	pruning ~ discipline {Prov 13:24}
						 {Prov 15:10}
					 	 {Prov 19:18} {Deut 21:18-21}
						 {Prov 22:15}
						 {Prov 29:17}
			~ removal of dead flesh {Gal 5:24}

3) 'Already' - when He washed their feet He declared them to have been clean, now their feet were clean as well
	'because of the Word' - physical hygiene is important (He gives us the example) but spiritual hygiene is moreso and is accomplished through the Word
	'that I have spoken' - not just any words, but His = {Prov 8:22}, {John 1}, {1Jn 2:28}

4) 'Abide'
		'in me' - how do we abide in Him?  it is more like being with Him; whereas He can truly be _in_ ~ Holy Spirit
	'bearing fruit' - this tells us the meaning of *abide* ~ to be attached to and nourished by.  The fruit is {Gal 5:22-23}

5) establishment of the foundational pattern of all things: one vine, many branches, and cruft
	'much fruit' ~ evidence of abiding; curiously, non-abiders can bear fruit, just not much.  It important to note that abiding is an action but not an outward one - this is not street-corner evangelism or working in a soup kitchen, those are results.  We must abide first, then He will ask of us those other things.
	'nothing' ~ apart from Him we can do nothing.  Not a little bit, or even temporary things...nothing {Jam 1:17}.

6) non-abiders are 'thrown away' {1Cor 5:13}
	'like a branch' ~ cast out like the dead flesh
	'and withers' ~ there is life for a time, but no nourishment (and maybe even fruit for a time, but not culmination)
	'burned' ~ the implication here is that those who are cast off from the vine are forever lost

7)	IF you abide in Him AND His Word abides in you (living with Him)
	THEN ask for anything and it will be done

8) Why does God answer these prayers? because it glorifies Him
	it glorifies Him when we bear fruit
	it glorifies Him when prove our allegiance to Him

9) How did the Father love Jesus?
	_That_ He loved Jesus is unquestionable {Matt 3:17} {Matt 17:5} {Mark 1:11} {Luke 3:22} {Luke 9:35}.  But how? by birthing Him, saving Him from the sword, maintaining His health and life until the appointed time...
