# John 3


Nicodemus represents religious leaders who want Jesus to be the answer.

2) Nicodemus is coming to Jesus undercover.
Note the analogy of him coming to Jesus through the darkness.
Unlike other Pharisees Nicodemus doesn't ask a question - he has no hostile agenda.
...i.e. hostile could just as easily be "personal"


3) Without a leading question to overcome Jesus can cut straight to the His pet issue: rebirth


14) [NUM 21]


16) "God so loved" ~ past tense, since forever ago

perish/life ~ nothing to do with this realm, but a future one


21) Like [Ex 34:29] it is obvious who had been with God
