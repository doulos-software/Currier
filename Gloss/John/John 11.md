# John 11


37) Are they elevating the importance of unblindedness above resurrection?
We might do well to think so...everyone will be resurrected, but not everyone to life with Yahweh.


44) "unbind him" ~ even we, after rebirth, are tangled up in our grave clothes for a time - and this takes an act of God
"let him go" ~ we are recreated to freedom, not into a particular path or mold.
