# John 13


Jesus washed 24 feet that night.
...to include those of his betrayer.


outer garments symbolic of His divinity
- [Php 2:5-8]
- [Rev 1:12-16]

26-27) The Unsacrament
This is an interesting parallel to the Christian practice of _communion_.
This one time Jesus bestows damnation by giving the morsel.
We though, by his command, have the opposite power: to be included in adoption by choice - symbolized by the bread and wine.


34) A New Commandment = "love one another"

"just as I have loved you"
- taught
- washed feet
- sacrificed Hisself

", you also are to love one another"
- teach
- wash feet
- sacrifice ~ everything
