1 Corinthians 15


37) what you sow = fruit of the Spirit, good works
       = a seed, the kernel

38) God grows the seed into a body
	"as He has chosen"
		already planned [Eph 1:6]
	a different body for each 'kind' of seed ~ a _body_ per kind, like a family/corporate entity

39) four kinds of bodies
        [Deut 4:15-20] an opposition to idols 
         ~ which come in reverse of the created order [Gen 1]

40) celestial bodies akin to [Deut 4]


46) the natural [physical] is preeminent - first a natural seed, then a spiritual one; first a natural body, then a spiritual one.
