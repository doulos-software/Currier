Proverbs 8


22) possessed ~ קנה = buy/acquire


29) what we these markings of the foundation(s)

30) beside Him ~ implies omnipresence (which implies dignity)
  master workman ~ wisdom actually accomplished high-level things
  daily delight ~ routine?  implies the pre-planning of rhythm and cycle which are god
  wisdom brings joy, always (as does its means האשנ כדש)


34) listen, not just hearing by synthesizing
  where are His gates?
  where are His doors?
