Proverbs 20


1) strong drink will sap an entire night of potential productivity


8) A powerful king drives away fleeting vapidity with scarcely a glance


13) don't אהב ~ have an appetite for, sleep
  simply open the eyes to see, and attain, the nourishment already available


21) e.g.  being promoted beyond one's station without merit
