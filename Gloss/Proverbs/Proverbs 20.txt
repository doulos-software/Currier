Proverbs 20


1) strong drink will sap an entire night of potential productivity


8) A powerful king drives away fleeting vapidity with scarcely a glance


13) don't אהב ~ have an appetite for, sleep
  simply open the eyes to see, and attain, the nourishment already available


21) e.g.  being promoted beyond one's station without merit


24) We can't fully understand our path and we're walking it.  However, we can often look back and see where we've been steered around deadly traps and trained for difficult crossings.
