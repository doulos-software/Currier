Proverbs 10


Just increase comes through righteousness of deed and speech


19) just the act of talking can be sinful
  we can't help but, eventually, sin if we keep our mouths running
  restraint is evidence of wisdom
  ...even an apt word can be too much


29) It is the believers lifestyle and attitude that keeps them from trouble.
This is from Yehovah, not a man-mafe thing.
He shapes us.
This same lifestyle displaces evil, not just from our lives, but from neighbors.
