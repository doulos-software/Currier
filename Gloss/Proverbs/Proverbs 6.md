Proverbs 6


6) this is the call: not come, but go
  because He is with us (omnipresence) the call is not relative to Him, but got the world 
  the unrighteous should consider the righteous
    it is the lazy who bear no fruit
    {Matt 25:14-30}
  wisdom can come via consideration ~ pre-application


9-11) our propensity for laziness affects everything
  We it designed to need rest, but how much is too much
  The ant toils without direct leadership - this really is a fundamental behavior, a change of mind
