Proverbs 11

Wis & unwise leadership 


3) integrity is a guide, it leads because it disallows us from taking certain paths


6) notice the plural: the upright have a collective righteousness and freedom; similarly, the evil are bound in their collective lust


21) God is just - thank God that the Father's righteousness can cover the child (and thank Jesus for the sacrifice that made that possible)


27) goodness = seeking acceptance  {Gal 5:22}
