Proverbs 17


4) what you listen to reveals your character


6) [crown] ~ עטרה / atarah
  [glory] ~ תפארה / tipharah


16) the answer to the rhetorical is: he shouldn't.  there must be some sense, some atemporal, non-action that precedes salvation; something that opens us to the Spirit.

19) We perpetuate our guilt, through sin, as the norm.
We tend to exalt ourselves and that pride brings downfall.
