Proverbs 18


1) pride and fear isolate
  the selfless man seeks unity
  isolation is a reckless course
  
  
5) we are all wicked and in need of mercy
...but it is appropriate to apply standards in the conduct of kingdom work


14) Willpower can see us through a great many trials.  
But, what do we do when our will crushed?  Nothing.
Praise God that He offers His Spirit - which cannot be defeated.
The eternal cancer of sin cannot be wiped away except by that Holy Spirit.


23) spiritual riches are not necessarily good - those who are physically wealthy may be poor in spirit {Matt 5:3}
