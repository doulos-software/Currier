Proverbs 18


1) pride and fear isolate
  the selfless man seeks unity
  isolation is a reckless course
  
  
5) we are all wicked and in need of mercy
...but it is appropriate to apply standards in the conduct of kingdom work


23) spiritual riches are not necessarily good - those who are physically wealthy may be poor in spirit {Matt 5:3}
