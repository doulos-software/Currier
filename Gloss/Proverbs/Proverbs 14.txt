Proverbs 14


5) people are not known by degrees of honesty, they are honest or not, liars or not
  the Word is completely true, false Scripture is lie after lie


23) unless your job is to talk, words are generally wasteful 

24) wise living naturally tends to wealth


33) "wisdom rests _quietly_ in the heart of MoA"
    ...but it becomes more and more obvious when surrounded by less and less wisdom
