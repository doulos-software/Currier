Proverbs 25


6-7a) never _take_ your place, let it be given to you
  the Lord places us for purposes of training and example
  do what you are told to do, He will resolve issues
  remember that you are the adopted, rebellious child of no estate

15) quiet tenacity works wonders...even with God - He can be persuaded and still be sovereign 
  well spoken words must be well planned


28) Interesting, the link between boundaries and self-control.  Establishing and maintaining appropriate boundaries is part of self-control.  This is not always keeping others out but, also, staying within it ourselves.
