Proverbs 28


7) the understanding son does right
  the shameful son _consorts_ with worthless people
  ...since our worth comes from Christ, this implies an association with anti-christian people


10) to mislead is to set a trap, there is always a goal in leadership
  mislead = שגה ~ ravishing, taking advantage
  blameless = תמימ ~ sincerity 


19) talk is cheap
  'a servant' not just anyone, implies the believer
  Words are enough for understanding
  ...but not enough for discipline
  ...they can be ignored
