Proverbs 1


7) FotL


12) the grave takes people alive and it takes people whole
  Those who even have a glimmer of life are not taken
  ...by implication we, who were dead before meeting Christ, were completely dead - there was no good in us


29) FotL
  fearing the LORD is a choice, 


33) listen to wisdom
  - dwell secure
  - be at ease
  - no dread of disaster
