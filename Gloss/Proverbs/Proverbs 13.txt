Proverbs 13


1) Oh, to be a wise man!


7) does everyone pretend?  perhaps now but not always, i.e. Jesus 1st and 2nd comings
  

11) perseverance; wealth may be money or knowledge or skill 


22) I wish to leave such to my progeny: both spiritual and physical wealth, to both natural and spiritual children
