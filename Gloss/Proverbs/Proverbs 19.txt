Proverbs 19


5,9) false witness, like Naboth's accusers, will suffer
  Liars will cannot escape their own snare, neither can they live in the end.


18) God knows how many stumbles it will take us to walk right
  {Deut 21:18+} - we rebels deserved death, but He pardoned us
  Thank God for His discipline


22) what does it take to be a real man?  steadfast love

23) fear of God = rest and satisfaction 
  ...we feel the hand and try to see the face
  ...no harm to those who fear the LORD?  Now?
