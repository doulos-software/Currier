Proverbs 7

2) How many of us actually guard our eyes?
  The fool does not
  The scoffer does the opposite
  The simple does not
  The wise man does proactively


26) you are not the only victim
  the one who is willing to fornicate (physically and/or spiritually) has no qualms and few boundaries
  her victims are humiliated and are many ~ but they are now the עצמים (mighty)
  The adulteress, as an office, does not have only one victim.
