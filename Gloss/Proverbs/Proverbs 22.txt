Proverbs 22


20) 30 = the divinely perfect number
  Counsel = a helper (ours is threefold and omnipresent)
  Knowledge = facts and learning, useful information

21) right ~ correct/proper which implies a standard
  true ~ implies an absolute and a source
  
  "those who sent you"?  This is the believer acting as agent and ambassador of God.


29) skills are learned (unlike talents)
He will/He all now
...an absolute, God places us where we should be
  The practicing is up to us, the circumstances bringing us to the palace are up to God
...not our doing, God does the moving
