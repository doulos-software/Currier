Proverbs 22


1) Reputation and influence, not money, are the root of power.  Likewise, reputation without influence is worthless - and vice versa.
Application: tell someone, honestly, something they are good at and ask them how you can be better at it as well.


6) Train up ~ active, deliberate
Child ~ Must be done to/for kiddos
Even When ~ forecasting the inevitable
Not Depart ~ we are forever, indomitably driven by our training
...good training is impossibly hard to overcome


20) 30 = the divinely perfect number
  Counsel = a helper (ours is threefold and omnipresent)
  Knowledge = facts and learning, useful information

21) right ~ correct/proper which implies a standard
  true ~ implies an absolute and a source
  
  "those who sent you"?  This is the believer acting as agent and ambassador of God.


29) skills are learned (unlike talents)
He will (not)
...an absolute, present tense, God places us where we should be.
  The practicing is up to us, the circumstances bringing us to the palace are up to God.  God does not relegate us to obscurity because that is not the gospel.
