Proverbs 3


3) we can, and ought to, deliberately seek to attain faithfulness and love
  {Gal 6:22} ... be faithful, be loving
  tying them on refers [partly] to the Jewish t'fillin


5) "your own understanding" is limited and faulty ~ a sample size of you is not a population

9-10) the promise of plenty is doubled: food and drink 
  The impetus for gaining wealth is to remember the LORD 1st in an increase
  ...i.e. on payday the first payment is the tithe and we do it as an act of worship


21) Maintenance means practice, honing and using skills.


27) Duty to man.  To whom is good due?  Are we obliged to serve all?  If so, it can only be because of imago dei - we have no other innate worthiness.
