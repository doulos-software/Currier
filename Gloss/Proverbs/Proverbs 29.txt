Proverbs 29


17) a good son shares in the labor
  a good son helps achieve unity
  

21) in that case, we must have been pampered and wooed from birth - because we have been made heirs {Rom 8:17}


25) We are trapped by our fear of non-Godly things - the antidote of which is a thorough realization that our King is ultimately in charge.
[1PET 3:5-6]
