Proverbs 26


16) we always make excuses for our apathy
   Even legitimate excuses are invalid


18-19) Satan has become psychotic in the rebellion {Eph 6:16}
  we would as well


23) Fervency does not mean necessity.  In fact fervency is like dressing over wickedness.

24-26) The Hater
  LORD, cure me of my hatred to avoid that humiliation!
