I Am Jonah


Jonah did not actually _say_ no to God;
He simply "escaped".

The Ninevehites worshipped Dagon, the fish god.
It is likely that Jonah's timer on the fish "marked" him in some recognizable way.
Jonah would have been fishy smelling, bleached, and reputed.

Jonah was racist.
Is denominationalism akin to racism?

God uses rebels and morons to proclaim His word.
...we are all rebellious and simple.
The miracle is not that God hated Esau but that Good loved Jacob.

Demolish ~ Nehphket
...more like _transform_ than destroy
...the question is whether the end result of the transformation is good or not.
