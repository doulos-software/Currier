# Jonah 3

1) "second time" ~ many Bible characters were given a second chance: Abraham, Moses, David
...this was the point of Stephen's sermon [Acts 7] which was interrupted by his death.

2) "that great city" this is probably a double reference to:
    a) the might of the kingdom represented by it's capital
    b) the city with it's suburbs (like _greater Houston area_)

3) "arose" ~ in contrast to the going down, down, down of chapters 1-2 he is going up now
