# Jonah 2

Did Jonah die in the fish?
Death seems more likely practice and with the resurrection sign in view.
Also, he prayed from. "the belly of Sheol"

Sign of Jonah
  [Matt 12:39]
  [Matt 16:4]
  [Luke 11:29]
  [Luke 11:30]

  1. The wicked ask for signs.
  2. Only one sign is given to the wicked: resurrection
  3. The wicked = this generation = Nineveh


1-2) prayed/cried
[Num 11:2]


2-8) All past tense
9) Present tense


4,7) Jonah pines for the temple: he seemed his deep need for holy ground/sacred space.
We have this in the assemblies of the Church.


8-9) Jonah finally realizes his need and the one way to meet that need: Salvation from God

8) Mercy is forfeit via misdirected worship
An idol is a thing, other than Yahweh, that we think will give us security, significance, or acceptance.

9) The sincere desire to sacrifice comes from thankfulness.
