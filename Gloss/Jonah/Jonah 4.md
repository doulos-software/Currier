# Jonah 4

We love mercy when it's directed at us.
...not when it's for others.

2) How dispicable are we to be angry at God's favour.
Jonah was trying to prevent this.


5) Jonah never answers God's question.
Jonah again leaves and makes his own shelter.
Jonah is still going for his will
[Ex 34:6]

6) Jonah's shade was insufficient so God provided the difference.
Jonah still needed his head covered.


11) Interesting that God slew as many Asyrians in one night during Hezekiah's reign.
