Ezekiel 11


3) Those who thought they were in the good were not.
The haughty wrongly parsed their circumstances and did not understand how God was working.

15-16) God exiled _His imagers_ - they were to be spared future punishment.

16)	"I have been a sanctuary" ~ for the indwelt believer the sacred space is within them [1Cor 3:16]
