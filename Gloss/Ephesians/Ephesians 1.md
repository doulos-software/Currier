# Ephesians 1

Blessings:
- Quantity
	The urgent often pre-empts the important.
- Quality
- Locality
- Instrumentality

Ironside's Door:
	Imagine you're walking down a hallway and see a door labeled, "Enter whosoever will."  Upon entering you see a banquet table set with only a few places set; one of which has your name at it.
