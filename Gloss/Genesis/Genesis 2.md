# Genesis 2


God does not _make man_.
He forms man from the dust.
He works on us and among us physically.


15) work & keep
avad & shamar
these are priestly terms as well


18) amidst all the good of creation we now have the _not good_ of loneliness.
It's also interesting that God considers Adam alone because he does not have a spouse.
Yet, God made Adam wait for her...


21-22) Crucifixion parallel?  At His death Jesus side was opened by a Roman spear.
We receive life from the water & blood.

23) As His bride how does the Church manifest 'bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh'?
