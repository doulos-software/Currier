# Genesis 3

1) why wasn't Eve startled or unsettled by the nachash?


3) God did not actually prohibit touching the tree.
This kind of extrapolation was to become a typical Jewish perogative.
...we should avoid adding our own interpretive conclusions to Scripture.
...this doubtful dismissal of God's word is the preeminent human failure


5) the elohim - plural, the divine council
	{Ps 8:5} {Heb 2:7}


9) God called Adam ~ any doubt who was responsible?


11) "Who told you that you were naked?"


20) Adam's responded to his wife by naming her (and later reproduced with her)


22) 'us' = divine council
