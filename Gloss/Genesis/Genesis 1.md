# Genesis 1

1)
in the beginning - time
God - force
created - action
the heavens - space
and the earth - matter

2)
Spirit = ruach ~ always associated with water
hovered ~ bird/fowl-like movement; 
	other bird/water associations
	- the dove in Noah's story
	- the bird at Jesus' baptism

3) The first words of Yahweh: "let there be light"
[2Cor 4:4-6-7] ~ Paul meshes gospel and light which induces the idea of creation in the gospel reception


31) "very good" ~ the creation is complete
