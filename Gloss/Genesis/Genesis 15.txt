Genesis 15


5) This is not a promise as to the number of offspring but their quality. 
The body of believers will be as the stars: this astral language is repeated throughout scripture. 


17) God ALONE makes the covenant.
What is the significance of the smoking pot and the flaming torch?
...prophetic of the shakinah?
