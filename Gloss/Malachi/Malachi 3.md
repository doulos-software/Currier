# Malachi 3


7) you were born into a world that had already rejected Yahweh
"LORD of hosts" ~ the commander of the greatest army ~ beckons us to come to him
The question of how [to return] is answered by a rhetorical:

8) We have robbed God...by withholding tithes and contributions; i.e CHARITY

9) The curse is a result of our withholding and it affects the whole nation.
Theirs was a nation known for, and dedicated to, Yahweh; yet, they refrained from their duty.
Remember, this was after the return from exile and the 2nd Temple Ezra-rabbinic revival!

10) Yahweh request a test of _Him_: bring the full tithe and see if He will not meet our needs.

11) Further, all external hindrances to prosperity will be removed.  Note that we still have to work the land and pick the fruit...

12) The reason for this blessing is: that the nations will notice and come to know God.
