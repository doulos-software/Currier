Ecclesiastes 3


1)	For everything = 'under heaven' ~ all earthly, created things
	Season = everything has a beginning and an end
	A Time = a specific location in history
	Every Matter = no event, thought, or feeling is unprescribed; likewise, none is inconsequential

*) Questions about seasons:
	Are they cyclical?  Do they repeat?
	How long a timespan are they?
	What is the emotional and tangible content of a season?

	Note that the halves of each verse are synonyms

2)	birth <-> death
		not cyclical for most people, definitely cyclical in societal and cultural terms
		joy from gain, pain from loss
	plant <-> pluck
		note that pluck is destructive, as opposed to harvest which is nominal
		definitely cyclical on an annual basis
		plating is hopeful, plucking is destructive and seeking

	birth & planting imply the deliberate beginning of a thing
	death & plucing are similarly intentional, but not always malicious
	
3)	kill <-> heal
		note that not healing is akin to killing, sometimes it's just a slower method
		healing is cyclical based on the recovery time
		random timespan
		killing is abusive and powerful, healing is painful but expectant and brings hope
	break-down <-> build-up
		often generationally cyclical, sometimes societally, at best the natural break-down of man-made things happens over millenia
		definitely repetitve, especially as successive generations try to outdo the previous
		break-downs can be passionate, warlike affairs - or they can be entropic via neglect

	kill/break-down is the deterioration of life
	heal/build-up is the instantiation of life, literally the imbuing of God into things

4)	weep <-> laugh
		these are, strictly speaking, very short timespans and, potentially, short cycles as well; but the state-of-mind regarding them can linger for months or years
		weeping implies mourning which implies loss which is powerfully crushing and oppressive
		laughter implies joy which implies hoping or having some desirable - obviously strong antitheses
	mourn <-> dance
		definitely cyclical corresponding to life events, seemingly slightly more than an annual timespan
		mourning is a draining experience that, when truely expressed, leaves us dependent on others
		dancing is truly unbottled joy, kind of like full-body laughter

	weep/mourn ~ the sequence of reaction to and expression of loss
	laugh/dance ~ the sequence of joyful response and the celebration to good

5)	cast <-> gather
		like a child on the shore we do this chaotically, driven by moods
		casting is the clearing away of clutter while gathering is sowing discord
	embrace <-> apart
		this is probably a daily affair, a life without embracing is unenviable
		embracing is the second most literal combination of humans there is, standing apart when an embrace may be at hand is a denial of unity

	cast/embrace ~ making room for unity
	gather/apart ~ planting seeds of strife

6)	seek <-> lose
		this cycle is depenent on what is attained: the lower the quality and the more temporal things are sooner lost
		seeking is the goal, though we can never see the Father's face [Ex 33]() we should certainly try [Ps #](); to lose is to not have a thing *and* to not re-attempt to re-gain it
	keep <-> cast
		this timespan is really indeterminate; but it is probably longer than seeking losing and there is no real 'in-between' phase
		keeping a thing is often a matter of perseverance and committment; casting something away may be done in a fit or it may happen after an ordeal or a long-fought decision - but happens in an instant

	seek/keep ~ [Luke 2:19](); we gain treasures on the path toward good things
	lose/cast ~ these are not necessarily synonomous (one seems accidental, the other intentional) but they have the same effect of no longer having the precious thing

7)	tear <-> sew
		this cycle depends on providence; some garments are seemingly invulnerable, some simply escape wear, some are often tattered, some are irrepairable
		tearing can be "accidental" but often accidents are simply the result of sloppiness; sewing is a skiillful repair that prevents further tears - the most skilled can make a tear nearly invisible
	silence <-> speak
		This cycle may be momentary, to be true there is silence even within our spoken phrases; silence can easily last for hours - months or years would be debilitating; likewise, even the most gifted cannot speak more than a few hours (albeit with the aforementioned pauses)
		Though silence is sometimes warranted [Prov 17:28](), keeping silent when the gospel is needed is a worse offense - to which side shall we err!

	tear/silence ~ Keeping silent about hurtful matters will never fail to rend relationships.
	sew/speak ~ In this context: speaking is related to mending = sharing the gospel.

8)	love <-> hate
		These actions can, seemingly, occupy the same moments in time.  Just as easily: we can hold onto them irrationally for exceeding long periods.
	war <-> peace
		This cycle seems always to span years.  Likely wars are simply generational.  In some cases wars are handed down like heirlooms with each generation giving a unique implementation of it.
		War is purposeful destruction of an enemy and/or his things; more importantly: it is the devotion thereto.  Peace is not the absence of war, that would be the middle-ground here, it is appropriate movement toward (or, process of) reconciliation.

	love/war ~ This verse seems to break the pattern previously established.  However, since love is anathema to wordly ways it is quite appropriate to make war with loving motives.
	hate/peace ~ Likewise, in this framework, peace can only come after hate; And, sometimes, the most peaceful thing is the separation of a wall.
