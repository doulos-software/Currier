1 Chronicles 16


8) 3 stages of seeking :
  1. Thanksgiving
  2. Proximai 
  3. Proclaim 
  ...all elements of gospel, [Mk 16] [Matt 28] [Acts 1:7-8]

9) 3 stages of praise
  1. sing
  2. Sing praises (plurality, either in number or in devotion (unio mystical libido))
  3. Tell, proclaim _His_ works

10) glory _in_ His holy name
  [John 17] ~ unified in Him, sharing in the triune glory  (though we are as a drop in an ocean)
  Let ~ ishmat, make room, lay waste, implying struggle or battle???

11) seek Yahweh and His strength [Ps 27:1]
  Seek proximai

12) remember, testimony [Ps 119:99]
  miracles & judgments _uttered_

13) to the Jew, defines "Jew"

14) Addonai _our_ God (both by virtue of the Imago Dei and the the redemption)
  His judgments are pervasive and ubiquitous 
  ...Nature is not permissive,  illicit behaviors usually bring harm

15) remember forever (which He must enable)
  covenant = commands (in the sense of decreed promises)
  1000 generations  ~ even conservatively beyond the end of the earth 
  ...into the eternity ?a change or new occurrence then?

16) this covenant = Israel + Messiah + rule
  Note the referred lineage: Abraham > Isaac
  _sworn_ promise [Gen 15]

17) lineage cont'd > Jacob 
  Statute ~ codified,  as a law
  Israel ~ a FOREVER promise

18) FOREVER the land of Canaan 
  ...continuous Jewish occupation (the poor remnant) of the land
  Portion = In the sense of a down-payment

19-22)  Post-Egypt sojourn 
  1. Remnant
  2. Overlooked
  3. Maintained and safeguarded in another's lands
  4. He rebuked kings e.g. Balak [Number 24]
