# Joshua

It is known that there was a great upheaval in Canaan around 1250BC  
...attributable to Joshua's conquest.
...it is with noting that modern scholars doubt the historicity of much of the book ~ many believing scholars emphasize it's theological nature above the endowed events

Evidence does show the overthrow of some cities mentioned in the book:
- Jericho
- Lachish
- Hazor
...but many others appear to have been quietly assimilated (if anything.)
