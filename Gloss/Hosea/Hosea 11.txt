Hosea 11


1) Similarly: we were loved and then called out of the world

2) Reciprocal to His calling they went after other gods

3) How could they not know their healer?  Perhaps because it was vicarious and we choose to dismiss supernatural influencers...

4) "cords of kindness" "bands of love" ~ these are bindings, not frivolity
"I became to them as" a simile concerning God's interplay and revelation
...again a vicarious treatment: easing the yoke is a physical act, as is bending down, and feeding; not to mention the literal fulfillment of these things via Christ

5) {Matt 2:15}
