Hosea 13


1)	Ephraim = fruitful
	Israel = prevails w/ God
	When the fruitful spoke, there was trembling and God was exalted
	...but Baalism incurred guilt
	...leading to death
2)	sin increases
	...metal images
	...silver idols
	...crafted things
	kiss the calf - kill the child
		Molech, the bull god (sounds like Melech ~ king)
3)	the sinners will evaporate
4)	But:
	I Am
		delivered from Egypt
		unique
		savior
5)	I Am
	..."knew" us in the wilderness (despair)
	..."" in the drought [Jn 4]
6)	they ~ Israelites (the peculiar)
	grazed ~ fed (manna (required kneeling to collect))
	a full belly = security = complacency = pride
		they forgot Yahweh, because they were no longer hungry
7)	lion ? prowling lion [1Pet 5:8]
	leopard ~ Greeks &| future Rome
	I Am (to them) like the kingdoms (enactment?)
8)	nasty mama bear attitude
	tear open the breast
	~ exposing the heart
	Yahweh will devour, like a lion (kingdom)
	...ripped open
9)	destroys Israel
		those who prevail w/ God, deflate without Him
	rebels against the Helper
		not ambivalent -> rebellious
10)	mockery from God
		they begged for a king
		the king cannot save them
	"...a king and princes"
		Melech ~ king (1 of these, David)
		Sarim ~ prince (many of these)
11)	God gave a king in anger
	...and took it away
12)	inquity of Fruitful
	...stored up for later (?)
		sin must be dealt with - it cannot be ignored
		implies it lingers...supernaturally
13)	pangs of childbirth (foreshadowing suffering)
		but the unwise don't perceive it
		...they _can't_ discern
	the unwise is not in the right place at the right time
