Hebrews 12


14) on the heels of a treatise on recognizing and receiving discipline, he admonishes to make peace.
  strive for peace, yearn and work for it - it either comes by cleansing within or without, by clearing the heart or removing one self
  also, pursue holiness, this requires all the aforementioned effects of discipline
