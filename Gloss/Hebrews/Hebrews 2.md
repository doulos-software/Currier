# Hebrews 2

1) "drift away" ... from the knowledge of the superior revelation [and work] of Christ


3) neglect ~ apathy or default (as in not keeping a promise)


5-18) The object of Christ's redemptive work is humanity.


9) Angels is used as a generic term for inhabitants of the spiritual realm who are loyal to Yahweh.  Interestingly, _theos_ is sometimes used in the manner (which refers to a kind rather than a role).


14) Jesus is human because humans are the intended object of redemption.
[Gal 3:26-29]



17) Jesus' sacrifice was "to make propitiation for the sins of the **people**"; not for angels or anyone/thing else.
[Rev 1-3] ~ "he who has an ear...to the churches" the angel is a conduit
[1Cor 6:3]
[Col 1:19-20] [Col 2:15] ~ refers to completed act
	[2Cor 5:19] & [John 3:16] are eschatological

Not only are we to rule with Him but don't forget that it is necessary for humans to inherit the rule because _Jesus is human_.
