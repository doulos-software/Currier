# Hebrews 1

1) "many ways" ~ The diversity of genre within the revelation only serves to enhance its singular message: the gospel of Christ.

2) "these last days" ~ could mean the dawn of new era, the early Church believed that they were in the beginning of the end of time

"by a Son" ~ this does not mean polytheism, it simply refers to the fact that Jesus was/is a spiritual being (this does not mean He is not the Almighty, in fact it implies that He is superior: Yahweh reveals through both spiritual and physical incarnations - He is both within and above these)

3) upholds ~ _pharo_, the idea of maintenance or sustenance
	**all things**

	"sat down" this Son (pre-eminent above all others) is _with_ God

	5 attributes this Son
	- the radiance of His glory
	- the exact representation of His essence
	- the sustainer of His word of power
	- provider of purification of sins
	- occupant of the divine throne
	* these are not the inheritance, they are identifiers which give this Son status

	radiance, _apaugasma_ ~ occurs only one other time inthe Septuagint: Wisdom of Solomon referring to [WOS 7:24+], [Prov 8] Lady Wisdom.
	"Lady" is grammatical, not biological
	[Luke 11:49-51] alludes to Wisdom of Solomon [7:27]; Jesus' statement equates the Father and Wisdom.
	It is not Torah which is superior but Christ.

2,4) "heir" ~ is not a statement of ontology (beginnings) or instantiation.
Neither does it imply succession or replacement.


6) firstborn

[Ex 4:22] ~ "Israel is my firstborn son", firstborn is status not chronology

the firstborn human is actually Adam

[Col 1:15] ...of all creation
[Col 1:18] ...from the dead
[Rom 8:29] ...among many brothers

Christ has status/qualitative priority - not chronological

[Ps 2:7]() [Acts 13:33]() ~ equates the resurrection with firstbornage

[Heb 5:5]() ~ equates firstbornage with appointment (i.e. status)
...this is an inauguration of Jesus' kingship



[Deut 32:43]() ~ this verse is quoted here and comes from the Dead Sea scrolls
- so, the author of Hebrews had access to that text
