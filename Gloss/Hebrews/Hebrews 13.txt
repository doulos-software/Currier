Hebrews 13

The Leadership Manual


1) God desires unity {Ps 133}

2) be hospitable, you may never know the good that it brings

3) we believers mentally share each other's suffering

4) the admonition against these sins is always valid
But, in this context it is especially against those with divided loyalties (to the world)

5) don't cover, because you don't need it.
Good will provide all of your needs.

6) Yahweh can deliver me from anything

7) Pay attention to your Church leaders.
Imitate their good parts.

8) Remember Yeshua, the unchanging, the ultimate example.
He is perfectly good and steadfast.

9. Don't be swayed by wasteful endeavors.
Learn from others' experiences - don't waste your time on idolatrous things.
It is a grace to be aware of the failures of others...that we might not fall similarly.

10. The implication is that there are some serving who are not saved.
