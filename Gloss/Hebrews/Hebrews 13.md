Hebrews 13

The Leadership Manual


1) God desires unity {Ps 133}
To the 1st century person, including outsiders into a family unit was a foreign idea.

2) be hospitable, you may never know the good that it brings

3) we believers mentally share each other's suffering

4) the admonition against these sins is always valid
But, in this context it is especially against those with divided loyalties (to the world)

5) don't cover, because you don't need it.
Good will provide all of your needs.

6) Yahweh can deliver me from anything

7) Pay attention to your Church leaders.
Remember them = investments of time, prayer, gifts

Imitate their faith ~ you must first decide if they have faith; if not there is nothing to imitate _spiritually_.  They may very well have advice and interesting stories but it is a waste of time seeking spiritual guidance from non-spiritual people (and not all believers are particularly spiritual.)

Consider the outcome of their way of life - we **shall be** fruit inspectors.  You may consider their wealth: physical and social; consider their station: respect, reputation, etc.; consider their demeanor: occurrences of anger, treatment of other via gossip, correspondence, and face-to-face encounters.

It comes down to gleaning: grab the good stuff, leave the bad, and vacate when there is not enough nourishment from the fruit (it is not worth your time.)

8) Remember Yeshua, the unchanging, the ultimate example.
He is perfectly good and steadfast.

9. Don't be swayed by wasteful endeavors.
Learn from others' experiences - don't waste your time on idolatrous things.
It is a grace to be aware of the failures of others...that we might not fall similarly.

10. The implication is that there are some serving who are not saved.
