# Hebrews 9

4) In OT the altar of incense was not in the holy of holies.
...however, this fact corresponds with the Samaritan Pentateuch which has a recension in [Ex 31].

5) Mercy Seat ~ Hylasterion; the important idea is that access has been **permanently** secured by Jesus' sacrifice (as opposed to the OT system where annual refreshment was required).

6-7) There are multiple obstacles to humanity approaching God:
- priesthood
- performing duties
- veil/curtain
- annual visit
- blood required

8) "indicates" this is a present, ongoing condition - Him declaring.


[Gal 3:15-17]
