Psalm 120


We have to become fed up with the world to truly appreciate the graciousness of God's economy.

"If only..."culture
  We, the immature, believe that only one more thing will bring peace.  The world purposely does not satisfy; "One Big Lie."  God alone satisfies.

1) remembering God's prior Faithfulness

2) falsehood personified

3) arrow wound = death in that era
      {Ps 64:3}
    Broom tree = a weed
    Broom wood = long burning
      {Jam 6:4}

4) 

5) Meshech = Russia, Kedar = Arabia
  Living in a foreign land
  "Woe is me" ... I am become one of them {Is 6:5}

6) when lightning flashes over a night road the fool looks at the lightning, the wise man looks at the road (to see the way)
