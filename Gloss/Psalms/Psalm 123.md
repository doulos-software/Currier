Psalm 123

probably written by Hezekiah when surrounded and confronted by Assyrians
  {2Kgs 18-19}
  {Is 37-39}

1) 'lift' ~ present tense
  ...any look to God will be upwards 
  'enthroned' ~ then, now, always

2) the fearful hand, it could crush or maim...but it did not
  ...needful
  'til He has mercy'  the expectant hope of the believers
  
3-4) contempt
  they hate Him and us 

3) the call for mercy must be specifically addressed: יהוה

4) 'more than enough'
  tired of feeling lost, tired of letting go, tired of wasting breath, tired of nothing left

{Heb 12:1-3} ~ adopt the posture of spiritual worship {Rom 12:1}
...be fixated
