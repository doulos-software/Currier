Psalm 37


1) just don't do it...easier decreed than pursued

2) _soon_ ~ a promise from the Master
	fade ~ no lingering memories or influence
		like grass, wilted, drained of life, ugly
	wither ~ brought low and robbed of nourishment
		the green herb is dried, crushed, and eaten
		in hopes of them seeking true nourishment

3) trust in the LORD, who else?  have we not yet submitted to His sovereignty?
	dwell in the land ~ stand your ground?  do not let others disregard you [Tit 2:16]
	faithfulness ~ by Grepthar's hammer...
		befriend it, keep it close, honor it
		stay close to the faithful, let them rub off

4) delight yourself in the LORD, the promise keeper, the creator, He who is sovereign even over carpal tunnel syndrome
	desires
		[Matt 6:33]
		[Eccl 1:2]
		[1Tim 6:6]
		[1Jon 2:15-17] ([John 2:15-17])
		[John 4:13-14]

5) command: commit your way to the LORD
	let Him pave the way, give you dreams, heal & sustain
	trust in Him ~ no one was ever so faithful or trustworthy as the Covenanter Hisself
	_and_ He will act.  He acts in response to the testimony

6) bring forth - from where?  like carving off a piece of Christ's garment custom fit for me...?
	_your_ righteousness, gifted;  not His any longer but truly given to us from His infinite wealth of goodness
	_your_ justice; yikes!  I don't want justice, I want mercy!
	It's a good thing these happen in this order; if we weren't righteous by the time His justice arrived we would be burned up.


24) {Acts 1:18}


33) him = who?; LORD does not abandon a believer to their own strength - which is, essentially, negligible;. Note does He abandon the wicked when there is a glimmer of hope for their salvation.
