Psalm 130

Is this a lament or a praise?  Yes.

2) The psalmist is drowning and recognizes His innate need.

3) a recognition that we cannot stand before the holiness of יהוה
  Ultimately יהוה is the one wronged by all sins.  "If damnation be justice, then mercy may choose its own object." Johnathan Edwards

4) why is God's goodness a reason to fear Him?
  {Hos 3:5} - fear that He will extract from us the payment due to Him
  {Col 1:17} - it is only His ongoing momentary will that preserves us
  {Ps 51:4}
