Psalm 121


Keeper of me, my Guardian

{Luk 2:41+}  Jesus'family made this trip


4) God never stops His redemption work
  He is our guardian

5) He is as inseparable as my shadow.
What do I need shaded from?  from the glory of Yahweh.  The only eternal danger we face is His disintegrating holiness.
