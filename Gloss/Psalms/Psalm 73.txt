Psalm 73


1)	
	pure implies purification
	...those who look to God and his followship
2)	feet stumbling ~ walk faltering
	steps slipping ~ 
3)	an old question: why do the wicked prosper?
	Ps 37:38,92:7 ~ the wicked are doomed
	...their currency is ordained for God's purposes

16)	wearisome ~ exhausting mentally/spiritually
17)	1Cor 3:16 ~ the sanctuary in us
	God gives discernment
	...about the future of the wicked
18)	Ps 35:6 ~ God places them on slippery surfaces and offers a nudge
19)	someday the wicked will be taken away in a moment by the terrors
20)	the next life will make this one seem like a faint dream
	Yahweh rouses Hisself and then despises them 'as phantoms'
	...how does God despise phantoms?
21)	embittered soul
	oweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
