# 2 Samuel 23


10) Even when his hand was weary he cleaved to the sword
  There is no cause for us to let go the Logos.


14-17) The Water of Bethlehem
It w as a fit of weak fancy that prompted David to pine for his childhood beverage.
The fact that his men went so readily showed their deep affection for their leader. 
The fact that their impressive deeds are expounded upon shortly hereafter is evidence of their prowess - these were no sycophants.
Upon the great pull of the gravity of the consequences he permitted David repented.
His offering is a recognition of his own ineptitude and the fact that God rejoices in a diminished pride.  [Ps 51:17]
