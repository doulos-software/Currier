# Acts 17


16) _his_ spirit: that one which is entwined with the Holy Ruach


18) _foreign gods_: they seemed to understand the geographical nature of principalities [Col 1:16]
Jesus & the resurrection were bigger concepts that are unique to Yahweh, they are His ultimate plan.


32-33) Some scoffed and some intellectualized: so Paul left, he let his seed lie.
