# Numbers 24


17) "star out from Jacob" ~ celestial language about believers.
...hearkens back to [Gen 37:9]

Also, Jesus [in a sense] passed the scepter from the Jews [ethnic] to the Church [sociological]
...the Jewish leadership of Jesus day was riven because they thought that the scepter had departed from Judah because the Romans had usurped their right to deliver capital punishment.
