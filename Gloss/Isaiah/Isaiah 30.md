Isaiah 30

1-2) we _all_ seek the worldly answer for security

3) God will undo our reliance on the world

18) the LORD is waiting on you to be humble
	{Jam 4:6} ~ God gives grace to the humble
	"Don't let the tyranny of self-sufficiency rob you of the miraculous"
	waiting = blessing {Is 40:31} {Ps 27:14}

26) may imply a correction of the laws of nature
