Isaiah 40


12) interesting: the quantitative measure of the stuff of creation

13) comparison with the omnipresence of the LORD


22) the circle of the earth ~ far precedes the scientific verification of the shape of the earth and opposes all other such thought of that day


31) _renew_ strength ~ implies a long journey and the means to cover a distance
	it is not nearly as hard to die for the LORD as it is to live for Him
