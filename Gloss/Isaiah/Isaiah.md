Isaiah


"The Holy One of Israel"


There is scholarly contention regarding the authorship of The Book of Isaiah.
The traditional view is that Isaiah wrote the book in exactly the form that we have it now.
Liberal scholarship attributes sections of Isaiah to other authors.
The truth is probably in the middle: Isaiah originally wrote the content but it was compiled and edited by exilic scholars.
The editorial view applies to most of the OT...and does not undermine inspiration.

Traditional authorship defense:
1) NT authors quote Isaiah-II by name
	[Matt 3:3] -> [Is 40:3-5]
	[Mark 10:16]
	[Matt 12:18-21] -> [Is 42]
	[Rom 10:16] -> [Is 53]
	[Matt 8:17] -> [Is 53:4]
2) Isaiah contains predictive prophecy:
	[Is 44:8], [Is 45:1] ~ Cyrus
	[Is 13-15] ~ Babylon was not a world power at that time
3) There are literary elements that lend themselves to a single author.
4) There is first-hand content from Isaiah's lifetime in the book.
