Isaiah 66

1) Establishing His claim on us
	He also establishes His dominion

	throne = heaven
	footstool = earth

	He has no need for us to build Him a domicile - He builds it Hisself
	He has no need of rest, therefore there is no such place
		however, Jesus did rest ~ does He still?

2) His 'hand' has made all things ~ ?the memra?  ?wisdom?  is His hand?
	But - why this connector?  implies that in spite of the preceding declaration He takes an interest in man
		and not any men in particular, but looks/טבנ (behold/regard favorably) on those who:
		- are humble/ינע in spirit/חור
			poor, afflicted ~ spiritually
		- are contrite/הכנ in spirit/חור
			stricken, maimed, smitten, dejected ~ spiritually
		- tremble at His word
			fear not earthly powers, fear the One who moves them
			reverential fear

	So, do we take this to mean our acceptance of our hopeless finality?  The man who is looked upon by God is a spiritual waste.

3) the one who practices false religion is absolutely disgusting to God

4) apostates choose their own destruction by their fears
