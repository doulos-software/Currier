# Isaiah 49


6) Israel's salvation is only the beginning


11) Yahweh turns obstacles into opportunities.
Furthermore He paves the way for a gospel blitzkrieg.


16) How is this not the risen Savior proclamation.
He always has His people on His mind.


23) this is an earthly promise as well as a Bema seat one
  the first part of the verse is mostly Jewish, but there are tones for the church here
  surely, none of us will be ashamed before God, under the blood of Christ, but neither will we be ashamed _here_: wickedness will not become good, impropriety will not become righteousness
