# Luke 1


3) "most excellent" is also found in [Acts 23,24,26] ~ it means this person is a civil authority

4) This document + [Acts] may be preparatory material for Paul's trial.

5) Knowing that Zech was in the course of Abijah allows us to date JtB's conception birth; because we know what course was on duty when the temple was sacked in 70AD
...JtB born on Passover
...thus Christ's birth ~ Sept. 29th (Feast of Trumpets, Tabernacles)

Zechariah = He remembers
Elizabeth = His oath

Incarnation Sequence Part 1
- Gabriel messaged Mary
- 


13) JtB = [Is 40:3]

14-17)
Seven aspects of JtB:
- joy & gladness
- great before the LORD
- nazirite
- filled with Holy Spirit
- pastor
- leader (as Elijah)
- giver of wisdom


19) Gabriel is always on missions regarding the Messiah

20) Zech was made deaf + dumb as a sign


There is a legend that Zechariah also took Elijah's mantle and gave it to JtB


34) [John 8] is an exchange regarding parentage


41-43) Note that JtB was a fetus and was a human able to be Spirit-filled.
Note, also, that Elizabeth is regarding Jesus (a zygote at this point) as her "LORD" - he is absolutely human at this point.


62) Zech was deaf & dumb, hence the signs


64) This whole scenario culminated in Yahweh worship
