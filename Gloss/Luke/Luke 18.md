# Luke 18

  be persistent
  "Not all prayers are created equally." Philip Ryken
  Practical atheism: acting as if you do not believe.

9-14) The Pharisee and the Sinner

The Pharisee was twice decieved: that he is better than others, and that that matters.
The tax collector was estranged, ashamed, and despondent.
