# Luke 5


Genessarit ~ Galilee ~ heart-shaped lake, Horns of Hatton mt. range

"Not every fishing boat is a pulpit, but every pulpit is a fishing boat."

4) Jesus is always in command

5) "Master" ~ there was prior respect
Miracles are preceded by obedience


8) This is the normal response of people confronted by God - true humility.
[Job 42:5-6]
[Is 6]
[Rev 1:17]


12) The leper broke the law to come in.

The 2 lies of sin:
1. There's nothing wrong with me
2. There's nothing that can be done for me

leprosy was "cleansed" rather than "healed" ~ indicative of the replacement notion of redemption


Things that don't mix:
- feasting and fasting
- new patch on an old garment
- new wine in old skins


[Mic 6:8] in opposition to our view of righteousness and associations
