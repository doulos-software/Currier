# Luke 5


"Not every fishing boat is a pulpit, but every pulpit is a fishing boat."

4) Jesus is always in command

5) "Master" ~ there was prior respect
Miracles are preceded by obedience


8) This is the normal response of people confronted by God - true humility.
[Job 42:5-6]
[Is 6]
[Rev 1:17]


12) The leper broke the law to come in.


Things that don't mix:
- feasting and fasting
- new patch on an old garment
- new wine in old skins
