# Luke 7

Centurion: "I am a man with authority **also**" ~ he understands Christ's authority


41-43) The Lender
The one of greater debt appreciates forgiveness more.
~ the greater realization is that every human has an insurmountable debt; thus, our appreciations converges as we are sanctified.

44) He said _to_ Simon ~ "I entered _your_ house" ~ the pharisee was named Simon.

44-47) Washing ~ not water & rags, but tears and hair-covering
Kissing ~ not to the face, but to the feet
Anointing ~ not the head & oil, but the feet & expensive ointment

48,50) "Your sins are forgiven", "Your faith has saved you" ~ Jesus is not decreeing her absolution, he is declaring it.
The woman's actions reveal that she has chosen Him as her master; Jesus is telling them what the benefit of that allegiance is.

50) "go in peace" ~ note that there is no list of admonitions here!
It is a simple statement of acceptance - the behavior will come from the heart, not vice versa.
