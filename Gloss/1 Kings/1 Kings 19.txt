1 Kings 19.txt

1-5) Elijah wanted to die...as he was running from someone who wanted to kill him.

4) "I have had enough!"

5) Yehovah's messenger came, counter to Jezebel's, commanding action and nourishment


10,14) This is an incantation, his rehearsed line about his appointment.
"God of Hosts" refers to the commander of armies.
{1Kgs 18:13} the loneliness is mouth precisely true

10) What he says _was_ true, but recent events contradict it: God had defeated the prophets of Baal and the Israelites slew them.

11-12) Good was not _in_ the storms; though He is the Master.  [Mark 4][Luke 8][Matt 8]

11) Stand, passby, wind, quake, fire, whisper.
Stand - because he had run and hid
Passby - Yehovah passed by
Wind - ruwach, the most descriptive effect
{Mark 4:39} - the power to calm the storm is scarier than the storm itself.


15) God didn't answer Elijah directly.

15-16) God's plan revealed
A. Goto Damascus
B. Anoint Hazael king of Syria
C. Anoint Jehu king of Israel
D. Anoint Elisha prophet

17) {Rom 13:1} {2Pet 2:13}
