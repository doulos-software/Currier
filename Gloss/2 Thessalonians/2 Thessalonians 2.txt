# 2 Thessalonians 2


1-4) Two events here: The Apostosia and The Revealing of TMOL

[Matt 24:10] ~ The Day of the LORD; apostacy + lawlessness

apostosia = a mass event, 

"The Man of Lawlessness" is the beast/antichrist
...this is a singular event
...the "mystery of lawlessness" is _already at work_

These may be consecutive but need not be simultaneous.


6-7) The Restrainer = probably God (definitely an elohim) 
[Is 66]
