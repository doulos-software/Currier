Matthew 15


3-6) The Jews had a legal mechanism for dedicating a gift _to the temple_ which they used to avoid giving it to another person.


12) The most learned, reputable men in their society were questioning the disciples' Master and it fretted them.

13-14) Those who oppose the truth will be rooted up and burned.

14) "ignore them" ~ we are directed to _not_ oppose bad teachers but let God deal with them

15-16) It's not really a parable is it?  Hence, the reason Jesus knows that Peter doesn't understand.

16-18) understanding, mouth, stomach -> feces
	...implying that such waste matter makes up the intentions of our heart
	[Jer 17:19] ~ heart = "incurably" wicked
	the heart is never fixed, it must be recreated
