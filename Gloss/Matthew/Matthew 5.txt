Matthew 5


13) divided loyalties make a person worthless


37) Biblical support for digital communications :)


43-48) This is the illucidation of perfection: love your enemies


46) Remember who wrote the book!  Matthew is surely writing about hisself - a true humility which can only come from the Spirit


48) This is not possible under our own power!
	You must take on His righteousness [Eph 2:7-8]
