Matthew 13

deals with subject matter not in the Old Testament
"hidden since the foundation of the world"

{Eph 3} ~ The Church


3-9) The Sower
	The Path
		impenetrable, no soil
		no birth
		no growth
		birds ate the seed
	Rocky Ground
		a little soil
		successful birth
		immediate growth
		withered under the sun [1Cor 3:13]
	Thorny Ground
		good soil
		successful birth
		growth
		adjacent weeds killed them
	Good Soil
		good soil
		successful birth
		multiplicative growth
		no death

10-17) The purpose of a parable
	1. It is for the unknowing
	2. It is for understanding
	3. It introduces a new perception
	4. It pricks the heart
	5. It is a blessing

18) Now, with some explanation of parables in general, Jesus exposits this one

19-23) Jesus shows us how to analyze a parable; note that He gives importance to many of the details in the parable - it's important to practice exegesis and gleaning rather than introduction
	General
		Soil represents a human heart

	The Path = one who hears and does not understand
		note the capability of the "evil one" to affect the transmission of Logos
	Rocky Ground = one who hears and immediately recieves it _with joy_
		has no root (root systems have depth and breadth)
		he _immediately_ falls away when being persecuted
		note: tribulation OR persecution; there are four different sources of trouble (your flesh, another's flesh, evil spirits)
	Thorny Ground = one who hears the word but is _unfruitful_
		cares of the world and deceitfulness of riches choke out the _fruit_
	Good Soil = one who hears the AND understands it
		bears fruit AND yields (multiplicative)
		[Heb 13:7]
