Matthew 6


25- 34) "Therefore" - after establishing the idea of a Master Jesus expounds on the benefits of having Yahweh as a master

31) anxiety about:
	food ~ manna
	drink ~ spirit
	clothing ~ belief

32) gentiles seek these, those who don't know the Master
	Abba knows that you need them

33) 1st: seek Kingdom of God (free to join)
		 seek _His_ righteousness (freely given)
	all these things are added - v.31

34) Ultimately Providence teaches us that we should not borrow trouble, we are given work here and now and all else is God's domain.
