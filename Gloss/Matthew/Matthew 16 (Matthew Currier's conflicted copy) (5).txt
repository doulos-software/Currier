Matthew 16


5)	the setup - they had forgotten to bring "bread"
	how easily do we get spoilt

6)	watch and beware of _leaven_
		the insidious thing that grows exponentially and imbues everything with poison gas (CO2)
	Pharisees = legalism
	Sadducees = non-authoritative scripture

7)	"We brought no bread."
		the realization
		taking responsibility?

8)	Jesus was already aware of this
		"why bother discussing it?"

9-10) Do you not _yet_ perceive
	implying that the answer is there for the uptake
	He also admonishes them to recount the past
	~ evidence of god's

11)	not about bread but Manna
	again warning about yeast/apostasy

12)	the connection begins to form
		a fragile connection that must be built up

13-18) The Foundation Stone
Petros ~ a stone
...as opposed to...
Petra ~ rock, _the_ rock

It's interesting that this took place at the foot of Mount Hermon:
This was known as the _gates of hell_
 ~ mountains were the abode of the gods and this particular mountain was, historically, the place where the Watchers descended to Earth.
 I.e. Jesus is literally building the Church at the gates of hell.

16,23) Peter's finest hour and his downfall
