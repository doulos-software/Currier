Matthew 12


1-7) Gleaning on Shabbat
	Why were the Pharisees there?  Were they following, tagging along?
	[1Sam 21:1-6]

7) [Hos 6:6]
	Note that He calls them 'guiltless' - He has not yet been sacrificed but is ?already viewing them from that perspective?


10) Is it lawful?  Is it valid to ask that question of the law-maker?
	bottom-line: it is lawful to do good on Shabbat

	Sheep were their livelihood, they didn't let Shabbat interfere with their livelihood but, rather, used it as an excuse not to do good.


13) The man is a type of pre-believing Israel, who must reach out to be healed and whose healing is used as a public example to all onlookers.


18-21) [Is 42:1-3]


32) Speaking against the Holy Spirit, in this case, means ascribing the works of God to fallen angels and demons.
	It is the Holy Spirit that convicts us, Jesus who justifies us, and the Father that frees us.


38) They _answered Him_ with a question; they are opposing His authoritative eschatology {judgment day}

39) A door is closed here.  Only the Jonahic sign remains for them.

40) Where is the "heart of the earth"?  the center?  that sounds silly except that we know very little about spacetime and what's really inside the earth.
...this ties _Sheol_ to the "heart of the earth".


43-45) _this evil generation_ = Israel; which is an example as it was cleansed and then ended up worse off because the evil ejection was not replaced with Jesus


[Hos 5:14]
