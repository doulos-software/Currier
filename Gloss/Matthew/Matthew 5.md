Matthew 5


1-12) The Beatitudes
He is teaching his disciples, in seclusion.
"up on the mountain" is somewhat unusual for an ancient person; most mountains are not readily accessible without significant technology and they were considered the abode of the gods.

2) The fact that he _opened his mouth_ to teach them implies a personal, physical Christ connection.

3-12) Each line of this poem contains a demographic descriptor and a resultant condition.
It is left to the reader to fill in the blank: what causes that type of person to achieve the mentioned status?

13) divided loyalties make a person worthless


37) Biblical support for digital communications :)


43-48) This is the illucidation of perfection: love your enemies


46) Remember who wrote the book!  Matthew is surely writing about hisself - a true humility which can only come from the Spirit


48) This is not possible under our own power!
	You must take on His righteousness [Eph 2:7-8]
