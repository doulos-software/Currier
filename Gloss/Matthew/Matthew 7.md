Matthew 7


1-5) Plankeye

6-12) Valuing others
6) The point of the pearls is expounded in v.11; Yahweh does not give gifts lightly:
  He gives better gifts than us
  He gives to those "who ask"

9-11) An implication?  Bread & fish are good (Logos & believers) vs. stone & serpent.
  Bread ~ Logos | Falsity ~ Stone
  Fish ~ People | Devils ~ Snake

12) The rub = gift people similarly


23) The word _never_ is so important here: He is speaking to people He never knew - workers of lawlessness - unbelievers.


28-29) People recognize the truth in place of the same rhetoric.
