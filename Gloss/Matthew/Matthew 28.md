# Matthew 28


16-20) 
nature vs. nurture is highly relevant in discipleship
- nature is where we were planted and this was a sovereign, creative act
- nurture is the circumstances arising all around
  - interactions with the natural world are providential
  - the free will of others in your life is also providential

18) exalt the savior

19) evangelize the sinner

20) edify the saint
observe ~ _tyrein_; keep the thing exactly as in [1Cor 7:37]
