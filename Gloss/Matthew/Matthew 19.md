# Matthew 19


16-17) Jesus starts the man by pointing Him toward the important truth for context: the incarnation displaying Yahweh's concern and standard

18-19) Jesus brilliantly leads the man in a tour of his predominant idols:
~ remember that Jesus holds us accountable for a thought as much as an act [Matt 5:27-28]
~ this is the point of Jesus' direction of this conversation 

21-22) Jesus unmasks what is keeping this man from God
[Ex 20:15] ~ God supports private property
...so, Jesus is not giving a prescription but outlining the idols that are foremost between him and Yahweh

23-24) per Matthew Henry: "considering all the difficulties involved it is miraculous that anyone comes to faith"

24) The _Eye of the Needle_ is not a door, as is oft propogated.  There is a knot called a camel which is impossible to be pulled through the eye of a needle around which it is wrapped...unless it is untied.

25) They believed that earthly success equated to heavenly favor (and vice versa)
