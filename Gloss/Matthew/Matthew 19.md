# Matthew 19


21-22) Jesus unmasks what is keeping this man from God
[Ex 20:15] ~ God supports private property


24) The _Eye of the Needle_ is not a door, as is oft propogated.  There is a knot called a camel which is impossible to be pulled through the eye of a needle around which it is wrapped...unless it is untied.
