Matthew 10


1) What's the difference between apostles and disciples?
At this time the 12 are called disciples and are given:
- authority over unclean spirits
- exorcism ability
- disease and afflication healing

	Were these abilities ever revoked?

2-4) The apostles are named.
	Matthew - always adds the tax collector label to his name
