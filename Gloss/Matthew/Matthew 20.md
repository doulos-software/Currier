# Matthew 20


1-16) kingdom of heaven _is like_ a master
	early morning
	hired laborers
	vineyard
		what is the vineyard? Israel?

	denarius ~= a fair day's wage

	can this really be about the Church? what's the wage? Bema seat rewards?

16) this naturally flows from the last verse of chapter 19


Prophet, Priest, and King
