Matthew 16


5)	the setup - they had forgotten to bring "bread"
	how easily do we get spoilt

6)	watch and beware of _leaven_
		the insidiuos thing that grows exponentially and imbues everything with poison gas (CO2)
	Pharisees = legalism
	Sadducees = non-authoritative scripture

7)	"We brought no bread."
		the realization
		taking responsibility?

8)	Jesus was already aware of this
		"why bother discussing it?"

9-10)	Do you not _yet_ perceive
			implying that the answer is there for the uptake

11)	not about bread but Manna
	again warning about yeast/apostasy

12)	the connection begins to form
		a fragile connection that must be built up

13-18) The Foundation Stone
Petros ~ a stone
...as opposed to...
Petra ~ rock, _the_ rock



16,23) Peter's finest hour and his downfall
