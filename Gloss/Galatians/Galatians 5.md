Galatians 5


22-24) fruit of the Spirit
	as B.R. points out - it is singular, there is one fruit; frutis are those who come after

22)
	love
	joy
	peace
	patience
	kindness
	goodness
	faithfulness

23)
	gentleness
	self-control

	lawfulness

24) don't forget the penultimate fruit - crucifying the passions and desires of the flesh
	passions = driving motivations that fuel us; like a raging bull we devote ourselves in singular focus to achieving our goals and partaking of whatever we will
	desires = our desires (as opposed to His); these cannot ever, on this Earth, be in agreement; we must put off our desires, hence John's proclamation {Jn 3:30}
