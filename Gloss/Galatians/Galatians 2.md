Galatians 2


Paul was made an example by God - we shant overlook the incredible humility of Paul, evidenced not by his account but by the relationships he had.

Legalism is just another refactoring of sympathetic magic: we do something to influence divine power.  This is a farse in all implementations.  God shakes His head;  the fallen laugh and work us over.

Barnabas was born "Joseph"
= son of encouragement

[Prov 29:25]


2) [Acts 11] OR [Acts 15]

3) Paul refutes circumcision as saving.
However, in [Acts 16] Paul has Timothy circumcised precedent to his ministry to Jews.

4) The Church today is infiltrated by moralists.


6) "seemed" ~ powerful influence is more typically subversive [Col 1:17]


10) Who are the poor?  The Jerusalem Church, which was very needy - mostly Jews.

[Gal 3:10]


"The prodigal son spent one half of his inheritance on wine, women, and whimsy - and wasted the other half."  Chuck Missler


11) Peter @ Antioch
I think it's interesting that Peter is called by his Greek name here, and that it is so similar to Caiaphas...the one who orchestrated Christ's death.
Is this a verbal cue?

Cephasian = one who creates religious demarcations


14) "Answer a fool according to his folly..."

15)	This is not to imply that Jews are not sinners...rather he is differentiating one type of sinner from another.

16)	Jews know a person is not justified by the law
	...we have come to know that faith in Jesus Christ justifies - therefore we believe

17)	How does he equate justification with servanthood?
	'seeking to be justified' - the justification of Christ is once for all, any further pursuit along those line is fruitless and heterodox.
	We have a fiduciary responsibility to testify with our gifts: if we indulge in sin alongside our ministry we are not serving Christ.
		[1Pet 3:7] ~ betrayal of an oath separates us from God

18)	Guilt reigns.
	There is desire to rebuild unless we know what we were meant to be [1Cor 3:10]
	In a way we showcase our (former) depravity by building on the work of Christ.

19) Thank God for the law!
	Without it I would never have known of my need for Him!
	Without it I could never have divorced the world and been betrothed to Him!  [Rom 7]

20)	Crucified with Christ - I take this literally: a part of us died on that tree, needfully so.
	We are not cleaned up and put into play; we are burned up and remade.
	Instinct says this must be figurative but intuition says, 'No'.
	Part of me wonders if there is truly some change in the organism due to salvation?
	But it cannot be so, or else there would be the capability to exercise our propensity for upsmanship and segregation.
	That physical element, whatever it is (in detail), is the faith that He gives [Eph 2:8-9]

	"loved and gave", the past tense here is so important.
	There are many elements of salvation that are present or future tense - but not here.
	The gift of Christ must always be in the past because it preceded my sin.
	~ [1Jon 3:16] love could not be greater because it was complete, preceded my sin, and was given in full knowledge of my further rebellion.

21)	It was that same gift [20] that justified us.
	The justification was not done through the law - the law never justified.
