When was Job?
	Genesis 46:13 mentions a Job, son of Issachar
		this would mean Job was born after Joseph's sale and moved back to Midian after the migration


Eliphaz the Eloquent
Bildad the Brutal
Zophar the Zealous

Two kinds of people:
	those that have something to say
	those that have to say something

Job wasn't sinless, but he was blameless

The friends:
* never offer prayers, only Job prays
* argue theology w/ Job
