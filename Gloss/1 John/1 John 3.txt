1 John 3

There are two powers within you, vying to rule.  Which one shall win?  Tis the one you feed the most...


2) what will we be?  astralification?
	it doesn't say that we _can't_ know, but that it hasnt' appeared {yet}
	...we will be like Him [1Cor 12:12]
	...we will see him __as He is__ (He is now ?astralified?)


8) the devil has been sinning since the beginning
  ?Since the first day, even moment, of creation?
