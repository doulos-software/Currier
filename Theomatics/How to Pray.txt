How to Pray


This guide is based on George Mullers advice of 'How to Ascertain the Will of God' in his journal entitled: "Answers to Prayer."

Answers to prayer will come in the form a decision that we must make

Verbally disavow your own will
	it is fallen and decayed
	this is the most difficult step for most of us

Never make a rash decision
	emotional decisions are very rarely right
	decisions base on simple impressions are less rarely right

Always seek Him in the Word
	God gave us the tangible revelation for a reason: to help us seek Him

The Providence Factor
	consider circumstances and the advice of spirit-filled believers
	prayerfully attend with other dear believers

Ask for a revelation
	always be ready to take notes when you approach the throne!
	ask multiple times and evaluate the response
		responses come from the Word and, sometimes, from the Spirit within

Make the decision
	one of God's greatest gifts is volition: the ability to make decisions
	this explains why the outcome is not important, He evaluates the decision - not the result (which is foreknown by Him)
