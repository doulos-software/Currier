Documentary Hypotheses


Deutero-Isaiah Hypothesis
	invented in the late 18th century
	claims that Isaiah has multiple authors
		chapters 1-39
		chapters +
	Jesus disproves this
		John 12:38
			Isaiah said
			= Is 53:1
		John 12:40
			'again' Isaiah said
			= Is 6:10
	Coincidentally
		we now have 39 chapters OT, 27 NT
		but chapter/verse not added until 15th century

Documentary Hypothesis
	Jesus authenticates the authorship of Pentateuch as Moses
