Bible Structure

Why the prevalence of 6s in the Bible's structure?  6 is...?the number of man?
What is the significance of 2383?  is the number of words given below accurate?
If the chaper/verse numberings are not inspired, then why are there so many patterns
 therein?
	Theory 1: (mine) these arrangements of the text follow naturallys from the
		inspiration
	Theory 2: (mine) the scripture is structured such that it naturally lends
		itself to myriad arrangements...
	Note: there are some OT books that are chaptered differently by the Jews
Why are there patterns in the Bible?
	1) God is proving His sovreignty by installing patterns within and between
		books that could not have been done by man.  The Bible is not
		currently re-written to include pattens...duh
	2) Proverbs 25:2
	3) It makes the Bible a self-verifying entity
