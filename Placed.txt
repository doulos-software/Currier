Placed - "why am i here?"
	All of life is worship
	I have written every word, often several times, that I have ever published.


My mission is to joyfully and skillfully combine Scripture, math, and music to motivate God's people to worship Him.

Music is a means to open us.
	by design
	allows us to pour out
	makes us vulnerable to inputs

Undistracting excellence (John Piper)
	Chenaiah

Healthy tensions
	work out your salvation with fear and trembling

We are like the bubble-boy

Gifted vs. Willing
	to what extent do we limit the Church by appointing the willing to positions rather than waiting for God to install someone who is gifted?  Israel had to wait 40 years...
