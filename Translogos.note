Translogos


This is an English Bible with important words transliterated.  I started with δοχα which is glory - but is not always translated so; conversely, there Greek words are sometimes translated as glory.  I think the astute bible student can appreciate and make use of transliterated words just add readily as any new vocabulary.  This has had a profound impact on my walk.  Ideally you would start with a fresh text and repeat what I've done.  Otherwise this will be a handy study tool for you

Words in the order they were replaced:
  δοχα ~ doxa ~ glory
