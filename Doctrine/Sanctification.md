Sanctification is never described as something a believer does to themselves.


## Discipline

= teaching consequence


Both praise, punishment, and privation can all discipline


all divine discipline is forward looking, preparatory
	when it hurts its because the correction is necessarily abrupt and severe


Godly discipline is corrective, not punitive
