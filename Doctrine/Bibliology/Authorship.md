# Authorship

It could be said, with vast historical support, that Biblical texts were written by the traditional author and edited by others.
Some texts that indicate this are:
    [Gen 14:4] ~ use of an ancestral name which was not given until after Moses' death
    [Deut 3:8] ~ ??
    [Ez 1] ~ mix of 1st and 3rd person
