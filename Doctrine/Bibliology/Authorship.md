# Authorship

A clear picture of biblical authorship is the tabernacle furniture: it was shown to Moses who described it and then replicated it.
\
It could be said, with vast historical support, that Biblical texts were written by the traditional authors and edited/compiled by others.
\
Some texts that indicate this are:
- [Gen 14:4] ~ use of an ancestral name which was not given until after Moses' death [Jdg 18:29]
- [Deut 3:8] ~ dead sea Scrolls say "children of Israel"
- [Ez 1] ~ mix of 1st and 3rd person
- [Ps 72] ~ "the Psalms of David are ended", probably means that [at one point] the book ended there
- ...there is also a great deal of parallelism in the Psalms which supports the 5-books of psalms
\
e.g. "unto this day" ~ what day?  [Deut 3:14] makes no sense in Moses' day.
It does make sense in an exilic time-period.
\
The point is that scripture was written _and edited_ [mostly during the exile] under inspiration.
