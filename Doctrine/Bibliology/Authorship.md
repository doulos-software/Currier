# Authorship

It could be said, with vast historical support, that Biblical texts were written by the traditional author and edited by others.
Some texts that indicate this are:
    [Gen 14:4] ~ use of an ancestral name which was not given until after Moses' death [Jdg 18:29]
    [Deut 3:8] ~ ??
    [Ez 1] ~ mix of 1st and 3rd person
    [Ps 72] ~ "the Psalms of David are ended", probably means that [at one point] the book was completed there
    ...there is also a great deal of parallelism in the Psalms which supports the 5-books of psalms

e.g. "unto this day" ~ what day?  [Deut 3:14] makes no sense in Moses' day.
It does make sense in an exilic time-period.

The point is that [mostly during the exile] the scripture was edited - under inspiration.
