# Interpretation

## Literal or Purposeful

[Is 7:14]
    virgin ~ _almah_
    emmanuel ~ God with us
    this passage declares a sign for Ahaz (which was fulfilled in Ahaz's life)
    Matthew is analogizing with this event
    the rabbis never took this as a messianic passage
    ...but the NT author(s) did

[Matt 2:13]
[Hos 11:1]
    this passage references the Exodus
    this is not a prophecy but a recounting
    it is quoted by Matthew as a prophetic type/analogy


[Amos 9:10-12]
    David didn't build the temple
    this passage induces an expectation
[Acts 15:11-17]
    James **changes** the meaning of the passage
    
rebuilding...Jesus
so that:
    remnant of Edom |   remnant of mankind
    the nations (goyim) |   Gentiles


## Obfuscation

God's purposes are often deliberately obscured.
These purposes maybe revealed later...or not.

e.g. Messiah
    [Ps 2:2]    [Acts 4:25-26][Rev 19:19]
    [Ps 89:51]  [1Pet 4:14]

[1Cor 2:6-8]
[1Pet 1:10-12]

e.g. The Bronze Serpent of Moses
- quite an odd story until Jesus co-opts it brings it to a new level
  - [John 3:14]()
  - [Num 6?]()

e.g. Jonah's Descent
- another strange tale of introspection
- ...until Jesus co-opts it as a sign of His sheollowance and brings it to a new level


## Original Intent

Abrahamic Covenant conditional or unconditional?
[Gen 12:1-3]
[Gen 17:1-10]
[Lev 26] -> [2Cor 6:15-16]


## Harmonization

[1Th 4] ~ one or two events?
[1Th 5] ~ 'you' vs. 'us'

Generally: eschatological systems are bound to whether Israel and the Church are joined or not
- these 3 views can have a significant impact on secondary doctrines


# Census plenor
...a fuller sense

The Bible may mean more than the original author intended, but it can't mean less.
    e.g. events may align perfectly, though partially, with prophetic passages
    e.g. [Is 53] ~ the suffering servant was not understood to be Jesus Christ until after the resurrection
