# Interpretation

## Literal or Purposeful

[Is 7:14]
    virgin ~ _almah_
    emmanuel ~ God with us
    this passage declares a sign for Ahaz (which was fulfilled in Ahaz's life)
    Matthew is analogizing with this event
    the rabbi's never took this as a messianic passage

[Matt 2:13]
[Hos 11:1]
    this passage references the Exodus
    this is not a prophecy but a recounting
    it is quoted by Matthew as a type/analogy


[Amos 9:10-12]
    David didn't build the temple
    this passage induces an expectation
[Acts 15:11-17]
    James **changes** the meaning of the passage
    
rebuilding...Jesus
so that:
    remnant of Edom |   remnant of mankind
    the nations (goyim) |   Gentiles


## Obfuscation

God's purposes are often deliberately obscured.
These purposes maybe revealed later...or not.

e.g. Messiah
    [Ps 2:2]    [Acts 4:25-26][Rev 19:19]
    [Ps 89:51]  [1Pet 4:14]

[1Cor 2:6-8]
[1Pet 1:10-12]


## Original Intent

Abrahamic Covenant conditional or unconditional?
[Gen 12:1-3]
[Gen 17:1-10]
[Lev 26] -> [2Cor 6:15-16]


## Harmonization

[1Th 4] ~ one or two events?
[1Th 5] ~ 'you' vs. 'us'

# Census plenor
...a fuller sense

The Bible may mean more than the original author intended, but it can't mean less.
    e.g. events may align perfectly, though partially, with prophetic passages
    e.g. [Is 53] ~ the suffering servant was not understood to be Jesus Christ until after the resurrection
