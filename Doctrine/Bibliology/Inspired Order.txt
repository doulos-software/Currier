# Inspired Order
...of canonical books in the Bible

It is impossible to determine if there is a "best" order for the canonical books.
...the protestant canon is more of a grouping by types, then chronology
	- given by Jerome
	- loosely follow Jesus' demarcation of Law & Prophets
	- This order preserves some symmetry with historical compilations and meaningful adjacency based on content and usage of the books.
Note that it is impossible to give a _chronological_ order of the books:
- there are sequential events that are split up between books
- the contents of books are well established
	- the transmitted contents are inspired
- ...and self-contained 
	- this makes the Bible resistant to dismemberment because theological principles are dispersed throughout 


This is the Tanakh ordering:

Genesis
Exodus
Leviticus
Numbers
Deuteronomy
Joshua-Judges
Samuel-Kings
Isaiah
Jeremiah
Ezekiel
Minors
	Hosea
	Joel
	Amos
	Obadiah
	Jonah
	Micah
	Nahum
	Zephaniah
	Haggai
	Zechariah
	Malachi

Song of Solomon (passover)
Ruth (Feast of Pentecost)
Lamentations (Ab 10th)
Ecclesiastes (Feast of Tabernacles)

...note that Matthew is a natural follow-on to Chronicles as it promotes Jesus as Kings
