# Inspiration


Any evangelical theory of inspiration must honor the two-sided nature of inspiration.
Inspiration is first providential, then natural.

Inspired writing is a phenomenon but is not _paranormal_.
...it is a culmination of a human life walked alongside Yahweh.


[Jer 25:13]

## Downloading...
Very little of Scripture is directly downloaded in a man's head.
Additionally, very little of it is dictated.
Yahweh uses life circumstances, natural phenomena, and language (spoken and written).
Many of the subtle variances in Scripture make no sense if downloaded directly from an omniscient mind.

It is the human element that gives scripture it's genre and flavor.
It is the divine element that gives scripture it's consistency and veracity.

Examples:
- Passover [Ex 12] vs. [Deut 16]
- Each gospel records a different superscription on the cross
- Slave enjoinment [Ex 21:1-6] vs. [Deut 15:12-18]


## Plenary

Scripture is a joint effort of God and man.
Yahweh dwells in the believer [1Cor 3:16] who writes through and on divinely adjoined (subordinate) things [Col 1:17].
