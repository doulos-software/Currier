# Inerrancy


Absolute

Full
	The IRS theory ~ we are allowed to round-up/down

Limited
	~ the Bible is only inerrant in doctrinal areas

Purposeful
	~ the Bible is inerrant in it's gospel presentation


Real believers have held all of these positions throughout history.
What counts as an error?

Again to [Jer 25:13] where God shaped man to produce His scriptures.
