Real believers have held all of these positions throughout history.
What counts as an error?

Again to [Jer 25:13] where God shaped man to produce His scriptures.

Inerrancy can never be used as the primary criterion in proving an argument because it presupposes the conclusion.
I.e. inerrancy may highlight a problem but doesn't necessarily solve it.

Inerrancy is sometimes used to impose a reading on a text to avoid _perceived discrepancies_.
i.e. we can't abandon valid readings because they appear to be problematic.
In fact, explorations bourne thus are often very fruitful.

Advocates of inerrancy must still be accountable to external evidence.
