# Biblical Narrative Diversity

## Insider/Outsider

How do the biblical authors deal with outsiders?

Starting at the beginning of a 1188 page book by chapter 6 God is so mad that almost everyone dies.

Characters in the Bible move from one camp to another.


## History

How do the biblical authors deal with the past?

Chronicles leaves out:
- David & Bathsheba
- Solomon's downfall via foreign wives
- The intrigue of Solomon's rise to power
- David's provision of the temple is a focus
- The northern kingdom is hardly discussed
- Manasseh's salvation is displayed

The when explains the why 
- the date of authorship exudes meaning.
- sequence of events is also important
  - first, what was the actual sequence
  - second, what order were the elements portrayed in
  - finally, what was left out and why?
    - e.g. [2Kgs 16]() vs [Ezra 7](); both genealogies of Ezra (linking him to Aaron) but one is shorter ~ why?!

i.e. 4 gospels because diversity is divinely enforced.
- Chronology
	- Mark
	- Matthew
	- Luke
	- John


## Theology

How do the biblical authors deal with God?

e.g. Anthropomorphic & Divine
- There are many divine being but Yahweh is unique among them [as creator]
