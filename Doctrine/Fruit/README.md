This list derives from [Gal 5:22-23].
There are two important considerations:
- Nowhere, and at no time, have these qualities been outlawed [Gal 5:23]
- The term is _singular_: 'fruit'.  These are not qualities that we can improve as in a skill; rather, these are evidences of an indwelling Spirit.  Further, they are attained by relationship with Yahweh - not through study or practice (which are also derivative).
