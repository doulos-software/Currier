Scriptural Integrity
	Infallibility = incapable of being wrong
	inerrancy = free of mistakes
	inspiration = an animating influence
	precision = "a cutting off" (of abstraction); free of cruft 
	accurate = carefully prepared
	canon = the body of ecclesiastical/levitical teachings
	canonicity = belonging to the canon, rules for belonging
	transmission = the means by which the Scripture was delivered to you

	{Canonicity}

	Psalm 12

	{Transmission}

	{Infallibility}

	{Authenticity}

	{Inspiration}

{Hermeneutics}
	prevision vs. inspiration
	scripture vs. word

{Principles of Interpretation}

{Literary Forms}

{Figures of Speech}

{Testimony}

John 10
	31-33) stoning per "blasphemy"
	34-35) oneness w/ God
	35) Scripture cannot be broken (the writings)
		transmission, inscription or both?
	36) sent to bring people to this oneness
	Unbreakable
		Is 40:8
	Complete
		Deut 4:2
		Rev 22:19
	e.g. Dr. Daniel Wallace's argument: minor variations between documents eschew fallibility because NO doctrinal error compound - defying probability they touch only meaningless texts


Isaiah 40
	6) repeat this: created beauty is finite
	7) the LORD blows, grass/flowers fade
	8) but...

Romans 3:1-4
	1-2) the Jews as an instrument
	3-4) God doesn't require mens' faithfulness for success
		Job 9:32-33 ~ He doesn't require help
		Ps 51:4-6 ~ He works for His glory

		Genesis (Jacob)
		[Num 12:1]
		[Acts]
	demarcations
	[Matt 23:35]
		Jesus authenticates/recognizes the original book order (first and last murder)

Covenants ->

Dispensations ->

Orthodoxy


Prophecy is Pattern


Revelation
	= answers
		is there a God?
		does He communicate?
		if so, what does He say?

	General Revelation
		[Rom 1]
	Special Revelation
		To know God
			[2Tim 3:15]
		To share God
			[2Tim 3:16]
		To experience God
			[Ps 19:7-11]
		To watch and learn
			[Rom 15:4]
		Disclosure
			...of what?
			natural/general
			specific
	Thief on the cross
		saved at the absolute last possible moment
		how many thousands (millions?) of people accepted a call on his testimony?

	Authority
		credibility
		relevance
		genuineness
		heresies
			rationalism (mind)
			mysticism (experience)
			romanism (christendom)
			neo-orthodox (encounter)
				fallible intermediary scripture
				Word -> scripture-filter -> man
			cultic (additional scriptures)
			why do these exist?  they point toward Authority...
		Orthodoxy
			the Bible is the Authority
			the overwashed Spirit 'illuminates' the Scripture

	Distinctions and Dichotomies
		Verbal Issues
			Revelation ~ Inspiration
			Infallibility ~ Inerrancy
			Authority ~ Credibility
			Precision ~ Accuracy
			Covenants ~ Dispensations
			Scripture ~ Word

		Interpretation
			= removing obscurity
				e.g. psephology ~ psephos + logos (pebble knowledge, i.e. counting) = study of elections
			= a conception of another's _____
				exigesis = explainable, "to lead rightly"
				eisigesis ~ a hybrid of 'eis' (meaning into) and 'gesis' as above
				Discernment = perception of right and wrong
			etymology = the study of word lineage
				God shapes word usage and language creation to His ends

		Illumination
			= clarification (also, decoration ~ remez)
			also = decoration
			Blindness
				2Cor ? - the veil
				?hidden name Rev 2
			Scripture's power to change
				spirit - rebuilt on salvation
				soul - healthy activities
				body - hygenic tendencies
