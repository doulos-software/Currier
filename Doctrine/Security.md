# Security

Security is based on God's ability determined by our believing loyalty.


## Belief

A believer is eternally secure, but not because of any human effort.
Security comes entirely from the work of the Spirit.


[Matt 10:32-33]
	Pretty blunt statement which we don't normally associate with believers - it is more appropriate to say that we _can't_ associate it with believers.


[Heb 6:4-6]
	It is impossible to be saved twice because that would undermine the deity and work of Christ.


## Loyalty

[Dan 5]

[Rev 13-14]
  there is a point of no return in allegiance

[Matt 5:13]
  divided loyalty makes us worthless

[Matt 10:16-22]
  He will prop us up
