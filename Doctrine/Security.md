Security


A believer is eternally secure, but not because of any human effort.
Security comes entirely from the work of the Spirit.


[Matt 10:32-33]
	Pretty blunt statement which we don't normally associate with believers - it is more appropriate to say that we _can't_ associate it with believers.


[Heb 6:4-6]
	It is impossible to be saved twice because that would undermine the deity and work of Christ.
