Instance
= a particular instantiation of the Holy Spirit through a group of believers


This term applies to a grouping of believers.
Of course Good is not limited to this mode of appearance but that's all we're describing with the term 'instance'.

The size of the group doesn't matter.

The agenda isn't necessarily fixed but [Acts 2:42] certainly gives a prescription.
