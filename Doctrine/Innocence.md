# Innocence


All humans are humans from conception.

[Col 2:11-12] circumcision ~ baptism

[1Cor 15:12-28]
	[Rom 6:9]

[Rev 20:5-6]
	2 resurrections

[Dan 12:1-2]
	avoiding the 2nd death = inclusion in the book
	[Mal 4:10]

[Rom 5:12]
	it is _death_ that is inherited


Guilt is not inherited.
Guilt is the reason for damnation = rejecting the free gift of Christ.
There are a class of people who are innocent because they have no guilt.

People's names are _written_ into the books of life & death.
This is an action taking place after conception.
