# Christology


## Nature

Jesus is fully man and fully God.
Hypostasis = the union of the two kinds (divine + human)


## Right Hand of God

[Acts 7:55]
[Eph 1:20]
[Col 3:1]
[Heb 1:3,13]
[1Pet 3:22]
[Rev 5:1]


## Parachoresis

Jesus made use of his physical body at the same time as His divinity.


## Mediator

[Heb 9]
[HEB 12]
[IS 43]
[JOB 33]
[1TIM 2]


## Imputation

Like the Cassican Surplus: a priestly uniform which is black garb overlaid by a white robe - just like righteousness covering our sin


## States of Christ
