Doctrine
 = a belief


By way of example:
	[Bibliology] is a belief system regarding the Bible: its nature, origins, and exomation.  There are subordinate doctrines to [Bibliology] and it is subordinate to an entire doctrinal system.  There are different paradigms of [Bibliology] but the notion of it is universal - we all have a belief regarding the Bible.

So, some tenets of a doctrine:
	1. It is exposable (able to be revealed)
	2. It is epistemological (has some truth claim)
	3. It is not atomic (a sememe is ammoral whereas doctrine makes implications)
	4. It is not tangible

	Sememes and items are [Patterns].
