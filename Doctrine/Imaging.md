# Imaging


Scripture describes humans as image-bearers.

Freedom is essential to image-bearing.


## Texts

What is the image?
- Both men and women have it.
- It makes us _like_ God.
- It is digital: a being has it or doesn't (no in-between).

Made **in** the image - b'salem ~ created _as_ His image.
Humans **are** the image of God
i.e. [1Cor 3:16] ~ you are the temple

Stewardship is closely aligned with this.

The list of items above is really a group of tools...they are not the image.
