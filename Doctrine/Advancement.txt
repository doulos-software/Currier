Advancement

[Dan 12:4] ~ knowledge shall continually increase

Even today we see an increase in knowledge about everything, including Scripture.
Discoveries compound as new experts arise who bridge the gap between specialties.

[1Cor 13] ~ knowledge shall pass away
	[John 17] ~ we are one with Him, someday to be truly One
