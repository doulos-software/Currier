# Trinity

## Decreetive
	Origin = Father
	Medium = Spirit
	Message = Word

	Yahweh revealed it though we can't comprehend it
	...it's a mystery: Biblically mysteries have a chronological structure
	- once hidden
	- now revealed
	- future understood

## Consubstantial

All three persons are of the same stuff


## Subordination

We often say things like, "the Son is _from_ the Father"
...but this must be a functional distinction rather than a distinction of being
...not to imply origins

Each person of the trinity has a different role & function

The N.T. Pattern:
	pray to the Father, in the name of the Son, in the power of the Spirit
		[Lord's Prayer]
		[Rom 8] ~ HS groans for us

Yahweh: "I will be your salvation."

[Gal 4]
[John 1:1-3] ~ unity & distinction
