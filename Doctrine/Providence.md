Providence
= perpetually intentional divine work in all things

The purpose of providence is to change our paradigm.

God is just as active in the mundane as He is in the spectacular.


## Determinism

The deterministic view is that universe is finite, thus there is a finite amount of matter, energy, and information.
Thus all outcomes are predictable via laws of physics.
Thus, there is no free will - everything was set at the big bang.

The problem with this paradigm is that there is provable randomness.
The fact that we have decisions to make and free will is a result of providence.


## Destiny

Interestingly, events do not explicitly occur because of the laws of nature but because of the decree of Yahweh.
So, human destiny is set: loyal imagers & rebels.
However, this does not preclude our ability to walk the path autonomously.
