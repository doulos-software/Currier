	dead men live
	together with...
	they arise
	dwell in the dust
	earth cast out her dead

	come, enter thy chambers...shut thy doors about thee
	a little moment (til indignation is past)

	preparing chambers


Rev 4


[Gen 19]
	Lot's rescue as a type of the rapture
	the angels state that Lot's rescue is a necessary pre-requisite to the coming judgment


[Is 26:19-20]
	dead men live
	...with my dead body
	   (awake and sing)
	...earth casts out the dead
	...come and enter thy chambers, shut thy doors, hide thyselves until the indignation is passed
	? does this refer to the pre-trib system of eschatology?
		i.e. believers raptured to heaven, then return after the tribulation

[Zeph 2:3]
