"household rules"

commensurate with _economy_

Matt 25:31-45
  giving to others ascribes value to them; sharing these values with Yahweh denotes our loyalty to Him.

In a financial economy we are valuated through a wage and workload.
In the divine economy we are valuated through status and talent.
...talent is vernacular for God-given abilities

The Biblical implication is that we are given work and the ability to do the work.
This is how we derive our value: that we are entrusted with status and power.
