[1Cor 12]()
[Rom 12]()
-	worshipping via the spiritual gifts
	-	the teacher worships via teaching
	-	the giver worships via putting their envelope in the passing plate
	-	the prophet worships via preaching
	-	etc...

[1Chr 25:1]()
-	he prophesied with his lyre?
	-	if prophesy is preaching (a.k.a. words) then how can we prophesy without words?!
	-	...it must be more
	-	OR maybe it is implied that he sang and played at once
-	אבנ - who should prophesy, bubbling over, the act of prophesying
-	א'בנ - prophet
-	...so, the sense is the prophet doing what he should do - proclaiming!
-	...there _must_ be Word involved, somehow
