Competency


Competency cannot be determined within oneself, it is determined by the teacher.  In our case, this is Scripture.

Elements leading to Scriptural competency:
	consistent interpretation
	literal interpretation
	accountability to doctrine
	symbols and numbers are explained elsewhere in Scripture

Doctrine = an advocated position
	our advocate is Christ
	our position is Truth
