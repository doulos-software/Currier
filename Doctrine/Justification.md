# Justification


Titus 3
	Holy Spirit poured "so that we might be just by His grace"

Interestingly, there is no sufficient dealing with justification for several centuries after the apostles died.


## Imputation

[Mark 10:18] [Luke 18:19]
~ Jesus said, "No one is good except God _alone_."
...both versions are precisely the same wording [in the original]

There is no qualifier on this statement: it is quite final.
So, how can anyone possibly enter glory?  Especially in light of [2PET 3:9]

The answer is imputation: not only do we not have goodness, we have no basis for goodness.
It must be given to us (and the giver must be divine (and such giving is fatal to giver.))


## Infusion

G.R.A.C.E ~ God's Riches At Christ's Expense

This grace is not injected into us; rather, it is a change in the attitude of God toward us.


## Objective/Subjective

Related to limited atonement...objective justifiction refers to Christs' dying for all.


[JOHN 3:16]
	the world ~ all, not a subset
	but have ~ not for all, the subset of believers


## Permanence

It is strange for us to believe that we can be justified without any improvement of ourselves.


## Synergism

God does His part, I do my part, then I'm saved.
This is not - at all - Biblical.
= Semi-palagianism
