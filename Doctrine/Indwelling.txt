Indwelling


NOT Reversible:
	born
	baptized
	indwelt
	sealed


Do we have...
	union without communion
	profession without experience
	life without health
	movement without progress
	battles without victory
	service without success
	trials without triumph
Are we...
	justified but not sanctified?
	on the right side of easter but wrong side of pentecost
	on the right side of pardon but wrong side of power
