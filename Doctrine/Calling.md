Calling

Destiny ~ parallels [Future](Future)


Election doesn't imply salvation.
Calling doesn't impose belief.


[Rom 12:2] - our calling is being transformed.

We shouldn't be surprised that our current circumstances are providentially ordained as we exercise our calling and exorcise our will.

[Mic 6:8] - our walk is tertiary - in terms of _us_.

As far as the walk: we are not told the gait, only the mode.
And it comes after being just and being kindly.
