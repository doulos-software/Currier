# Discernment
... the gift of knowing whether a message is from Yahweh

How do we determine the origin of a message?
It is not the means of transmission: God uses many means by providence.

Rather, we know the attributes of God's messages:
1) [Rev 19:10] it all points to Jesus
2) [2Tim 3:16] it has a gospel purpose

Regardless, everything should be tested against Scripture [Acts 17:11].
