# Divine Council
"_Yahweh is an elohim, but no other elohim is Yahweh_"

[Ps 89:6]

This exposes a worldview connundrum.
The implication is simply that "elohim" describes a type of being.
Yahweh is unique among them and pre-existent.
Yahweh created the others.

## Future

The council will, one day, be reconstituted as Yahweh desires.
[Rev 3:20-21] is an example ~ we will sit **with Him** on **His** throne!
In fact, all of the _conqueror_ talk in [Rev 2,3] looks forward to this.
