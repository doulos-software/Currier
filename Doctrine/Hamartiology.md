Sin is a roman archery term meaning "to miss the mark"
...this doesn't mean that we hit an outer ring rather than the bullseye - it means we fell short of the target entirely.

Sin is a state of being - not an individual wrong act.


Three aspects of sin
- penalty
- power
- presence


Jesus was "made sin" for us
	[John 3:14]


## Transgression

Even loyal believers do wrong - and do so willingly.
But doing a wrong thing is not rightly described as "sinning" because this is too graying.

Sin is a state of being - which a loyal believer is not.
A transgression is an act of rebellion - which every loyal believer is certainly capable of.


## Effects

Our abhorrent behavior is like a roadmap showing us our deep needs.
Deliberate consideration of behaviors and the circumstances when they came about are like a roadmap to transformation.
