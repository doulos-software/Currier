Divine Dispensations


Two Sides:
	Covenantal Theology
	Dispensationalism

	unfortunately, these two terms are not descriptive of the two points of view (at least not of their important aspects)


commonalities w/ "non-dispensationalists"
	unified plan of salvation
	unified people of God
		[1Pet 1:1-2]
		[1Pet 2:9-10]
	current aspect of the kingdom of God
		[Rom 14:17]
	single basis of salvation
	    [Eph 2:8-9]
		grace alone through faith alone
	spiritual seed of Abraham
	    [Gal 3:16]


primary sticking points:
	normal, plain, consistent hermeneutic
	glory of God as the unifying theme of all Scripture and history
		1. program of redemption
		2. program for Israel
		3. punishment of the wicked
		4. plan for angels
		5. nature
	distinction between Israel and Church
	literal Israel
	literal kingdom
	literal trib
	literal rapture

Cov's vs. Dispy's
	cov's tend to treat Scripture allegorically
	dispy's tend to take Scripture literally

	cov's tend toward replacement theology (of varying degrees)
	dispy's tend toward literal Israel (and the distinction of genetic Jews)

	cov's tend toward amillenial eschatology (or other similar views like post-trib)
	dispy's tend toward pre-millenial, and mostly pre-trib
		mid-trib is defensible for a dispy but becomes tricky


Dispensation
	?dispensing of what?
	~ a period of time bracketed by covenants
	more of an economic term: production, distribution, and consumption
	~ man is tested, in respect of obedience, according to the current revelation of God
	= household management is implied

Covenant
	Fiduciary arrangement (suzerainty)
		suzerain (delegator)
			a sovereign having control over another state that is internally autonomous
		specific responsibilities
		accountabiilty
			repercussions
		specific instantiation
			[Eph 3:2]
			[Col 1:25-26]


The Issue of Scripture
	The Revelation in regards to Dispy
		- divinely deposited
		- human stewardship (fiduciary)
		- chronological and progressive


The Issue of Israel and the Church (and Jews)
	this doctrine is _heavily_ dependent on our hermeneutic
	Church (invisible)
		the Church is pre-eminent [Eph 1:22-23]
		the צחק/Εκλεσσια is eternal (from/to) [Deut 4:10] [Acts 7:38]
		membership via Spirit baptism [1Jn 2:27]
			[Heb 12:23] [2Tim 2:19]
		*ecclesiastical interval between Daniels 69th & 70th weeks
	church (visible)
		the Body as perceived by 'true believers' [1Cor 1:2] [1Thess 1:1] [Phm 1-2]


The Issue of End Times
