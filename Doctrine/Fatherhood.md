# Fatherhood

The story is of the relationship that God has with us.


Gen 2:24 - a father trains sons to be independent (relatively speaking)
Genealogies - a father has a legacy of family
Ps 27:10 - an earthly (?focused?) father is not dependable
Ps 89:26 - God is the ultimate Father
Ps 103:13 - a father is compassionate
Prv 3:12 - a father corrects his son (children)


## Prodigal Son

The younger son essentially says, "I want you dead so that I can have my inheritance."

The Father's character is starkly revealed in two ways:
1. He pined for the return of the younger son and was exultant at his return
2. He graciously accepted the older son who was, theologically, in the same state as the younger son


## Grace

Grace does not imply permisiveness

Interestingly, the woman is the vehicle for the law while the father is the head.
