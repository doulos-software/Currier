Attendance


How can Satan stand before a holy God (as in Job)?
Is it because the accuser is on God's side?
Is it because their sinfulness is permanent and retributable?

'Satan' is actually a title akin to _prosecutor_ in modern parlance.
This does not necessarily refer to Lucifer - it could be an allied angel which takes on this role.

Then again, the opposition does present themselves before God in [Ps 82]().
Yahweh, apparently, has a facility available to encounter fallen beings without destroying.
Hallelujah for that!
If it were not so we would be hopelessly lost.
