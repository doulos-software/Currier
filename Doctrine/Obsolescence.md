Obsolescence
= falling into disuse


[1Cor 3:9-17]

[Eph 2:19-22]

[Lev 14:33-47]


The Church is the temple, the dwelling place, of God.

There are two methods by which it may be destroyed:
	1) [1Cor 3:17] ~ human hands can tear down a temple (an individual element of the )
	2) God imposes destruction by planting a disease [Lev 14:34]

The structural stones of the Temple/Church are the believers.

Those that are diseased are removed.

It is possible that an entire ministry may thus be disbanded providentially.
