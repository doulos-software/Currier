Purpose
  Layman serve at the pleasure of God to discover the pleasure of serving.

Sovereignty
  {1Chr 15:22} ~ Chenaiah, whose name means 'disposition of the LORD', was placed in his position by another because he good at it.
  God gave each human a unique set of talents and skills and placed them where they.  We assume that He brought us to this time and place on purpose.  However, we must evaluate whether our desire to do a work is based on our passion or a calling from the Master.

Character
  {Rom 14} is the ultimate chapter on the character of service.  Make no mistake, if you are reading this document then you are a minister.  If you become a _public_ minister will be held to a higher standard.  We require a higher standard of living from those involved in our ministries.
  Verse 12 tells us that we will be judged for our works.  {1Cor 3} tells us that this has nothing to do with salvation, rather we have the opportunity for greater blessings beyond salvation.
  {2Cor 6} teaches us to refrain from things that may negatively affect other people.  To minister to the Church on behalf of Christ you must give up your wordly desires and behavior.  Makes no mistake, if you are in Church ministry you must grow away from the world or God will remove you; {1Cor 5} gives us an example of this.

Accountability
  No one is perfect.  No one can maintain the high standards of God's calling...especially not alone.  We need the Spirit and the help of being accountable to each other.
  Christians embrace accountability for two reasons.  1) We need it to grow.  2) It gives evidence that Spirit is working in us and in others.
  {Gal 6} gives us the pattern of Christian accountability.  We restore each other and bear each other's burdens.  This implies that we must share with each other and be involved in and interested in each other's lives.
