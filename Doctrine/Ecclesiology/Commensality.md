Commensality
= the practice of eating together


Rooted in the word commensal which describes things occupying the same space in _nutritional harmony_.

As slaves of Yahweh we occupy the same sacred space when we gather.
Therefore, unity must be practiced by eating together AND partaking of sacraments together.
