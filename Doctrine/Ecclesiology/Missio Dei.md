# Missio Dei

No dominant theological system today begins with missions.
...this is part of the legacy of the reformation.

## Mission

Mission is, potentially, the fundamental paradigm missing from beneath modern Christian worldviews.

It should serve as the dramatic purpose driving:
- Hermeneutics
- Theology
- Education
- Ecclesiology
- Anthropology


God takes the initiative:
	He is the sender
	He is the sent

If this time (from the resurrection to the 2nd coming) is ordained to reach the nations then doesn't it follow that the sent people are sent to that end?


## Imago Dei

From a missional perspective, what does it mean to be human?

[Gen 1:26]()
[Gen 5:1]()
[Gen 9:6]()

[1Cor 11:7]()
[Jam 3:9]()
