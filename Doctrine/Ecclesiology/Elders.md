# Elders


Plurality - elders


[1Tim 3]
[Tts 1]

Do the qualifications require such a one to serve?

These qualifications are _minimal_
	they are culturally recognizble


?Pastor = Elder?
	M.Dever

Distinction between "elder" & "deacon"
	[Acts 6:2+]
		deacons are table-waiters/servants
		"prayer and the ministry of the word of God"
	[Acts 15]
	[Acts 20]

	"senior pastor"
		not directly Biblical
		though there may be a predominant preacher or shepherd


Views Toward Eldership
	recognition ~ an elder is a gift to the Church from God
		[]
		[Heb 13:6]
	trust ~ 
		[1Tim 5:17]
	godliness ~ evident, blameless

	carefulness
	results


Congregational Responsiblity:
	[Matt 18]
		Jesus says the final authority in disciplinary matters is the congregation
	[Acts 6]
		the congregation chose the deacons
	[1Cor 5]
		the congregation needed to act
	[2Cor 2:6-8]
