# Eschatology


[Amos 5:18]


## Typical Topics

### Millenium


### Israel
Promises made to Israel:
	Unconditional:
		[Gen 12:1-3]
		[Gen 15:5,18]
	Conditional on behavior:
		[Gen 17:1-2,8-10]
		[Gen 22:15-18]
		[Deut 11:18-24]

The Borders
	[Gen 15:18]
	[Ex23:31]

Who is "all Israel"?

Questions:
- Does the nation of Israel need to exist in end-times?
- Was the 70AD exile final?
- Was Israel ever geographically complete?
- Must all Jews be re-gathered?

[Acts 2] sees Jews from all the known world coming, believing, and going home.  [Is 66]
[Lev 26] ~ Yahweh's dwelling; the interpretation of this passage drives the interpretation of NT Israel dealings.

[Gal 3] doesn't specifically connect the land to Israel


### Temple
- quotes [Lev 26]
- [2Cor 6]
- [Luke 1]
- [Acts 1]


### Kingdom of God
- [Acts 8:12]
- [Acts 19:8]
- [Col 1:13] ~ note the past-tenses
- [2Tim 4:18]
- [Rev 1:6]
- [Rev 5:10]


### The Day of the LORD
[Joel 2:1]


### Return of Christ
One or two?  Splitter or Joiner?

Rapture or Resurrection?
[1Th 4]
[1Cor 15:51,54]
[Rev 20:7-10]
[1Cor 15:22-26]
[Matt 16:27]
[Matt 25:31]
[2Th 1:1,7-10]

Imminence
- Does anything prevent the return of Christ?
	- What is "soon"?
	- Is it unexpected for all? or just those not paying attention?

[2Th 2] ~ generic timeline
[1Th 5]


### Rapture
equate 70th week of Daniel w/ tribulation
...except pre-wrath which say trib < 3.5wks

imminent
...except mid-trib - which constrains the time

Is Church present in [Rev 4-18]
[Matt 24]?

[1Th 1:9-10] ~ 'ek' ~= from || out of
...what if this refers to the final judgment

"church" does not occur in Revelation 4-18
...but saints does occur in [Rev 13:7,10] [Rev 16:6] [Rev 17:6] [Rev 18:24]


### Chronology
Recapitulation Judgment view says seals, trumpets, & bowls describe the same events

[Matt 24]
Either:
- both refer to the rapture
- [1Th 4] + [1Cor 15] split them into two things


### Strong Positions
The Kingdom of God is here [Col 1:13]

The Church does inherit the Abrahamic covenant [Gal 3:25-29]

The Church is the household of David [Acts 15:16-17]

The Church is the temple of God [1Cor 3:16] [1Cor 6:19]
...on of these references is singular, the other plural

There are discernable signs prior to the 2nd coming


### Uncertainties
What is the extent of the Kingdom of God?

Does national Israel play a part in unfulfilled Biblical prophecy [Rom 11:25-32]

Will there be a visible kingdom when messiah returns?

Gleaning dates from scripture is futile


### Lamenesses
No partial rapture

Gog/Magog is not Russia [Ez 38-39] [Rev 20]

Ethnic/cultural background of antichrist doesn't matter
