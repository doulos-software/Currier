"I put a case of leprous disease" - God
	walls - 1Cor 3:13
	house - us, made of walls
	city - many houses, the Church
	green - growth/life
	red - blood/war
	plaster ~ similar to clay but a covering
		clay - dust & water mixed (man & Spirit)
	garments - our spiritual life (saints wear white linen)

We are priests in Christ
empty the house
then examine the disease
	otherwise everything will be unclean
walls, green, red, deeper than the surface
	shut up for 7 days
	re-examine
	if it has spread then
		remove the diseased wall portions and discard them
		scrape entirety of the walls
		install new walls
		apply new plaster
	if it returns the house is unclean
		break down the house (stones, timber, & plaster)
		rubble carried out of the city
		people who enter our house are those that we share our lives with
		people who sleep in our house are those that depend on us 
		people who eat with us are those we teach
