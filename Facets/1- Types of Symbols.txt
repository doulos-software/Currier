We are heavily (almost exclusively) dependent on Hitchcock’s “Dictionary of Bible Names” to dissect and utilize the meanings of Biblical names.

Biblical numerology is commonly held and, as such, there is no single citation for this information: it has been gleaned over the years from various studies and this list, to the best of my knowledge, is unique.
	1 = perfection
	2 = partnership
	3 = communion (in a relational sense)
	4 = creation
	5 = grace
	6 = humanity
	7 = righteousness
	8 = redemption
	12 = establishment

	When you start getting into multiples you will see that we factor the number into its smallest factors and analyze them together.
