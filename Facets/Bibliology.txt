Laws of Interpretation
	The Golden Rule - WHEN THE PLAIN SENSE OF SCRIPTURE MAKES COMMON SENSE...TAKE IT!
		primary, literal, ordinary
			'secondary' importance is implied for other levels of interpretation
		rationalism
		context vs. pretext (beware the eisigesis)
	Law of First Mention
		= the first mention of a thing has special significance
		'things' often develop from simple to complex (or vice versa)
		idealogical coloring
	The Stereo Law
		an identical mention of a thing in another context has special significance
		Luke 4:18-19 ~ Isaiah 61 (He stops at a comma, what's next?)
		
	Law of Structural Integrity
		the Bible pre-answers heresies before they are invented
		John 1:1
		John 12 ()
	Law of Recurrence
		important ideas are scattered throughout (spread spectrum :)
	Law of Dichotomies
		many Biblical ideas are forehead-slappers
			many of these involve an understanding of time/space that we cannot have
		election vs. calling
		trinity
