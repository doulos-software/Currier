Bibliology = knowledge of "the book"

Why?
	Revelation
		disclosure
		...of what?
		natural/general
		specific

What?
	Canonical
		= officially accepted
		by whom?
		as opposed to what?
				
How?
	Inspiration
		verbal = in the form of words (verbage)
		plenary = unqualified, fully attended

	Infallibility
		inerrancy = incapable of being wrong
		precision = every thought perfectly placed

	Illumination
		= clarification (also, decoration ~ remez)
		also = decoration
			remez ~ "hint" of something deeper	

	Interpretation
		= removing obscurity
			e.g. psephology ~ psephos + logos (pebble knowledge, i.e. counting) = study of elections
		= a conception of another's _____
			exigesis = explainable, "to lead rightly"
			eisigesis ~ a hybrid of 'eis' (meaning into) and 'gesis' as above
			Discernment = perception of right and wrong

			
	Levels of Inspiration
		historical
		prophetic
		allegorical
		implication
			remez = hint
			allusion rather than exposition
				patterns
				"prophecy is pattern"
				names
			symbology (plants, animals, woods, metals)
			numbers, syllabic meanings, meta-data (tread lightly)
			ELSs (tread lightlier)
		examples
			Noah's genealogy
			Isaiah 37
			Paul's conversion and later testimony (Acts 9 & 26)
			John 1:1

	Laws of Interpretation
		The Golden Rule - WHEN THE PLAIN SENSE OF SCRIPTURE MAKES COMMON SENSE...TAKE IT!
			primary, literal, ordinary
				'secondary' importance is implied for other levels of interpretation
			rationalism
			context vs. pretext (beware the eisigesis)
		Law of First Mention
			= the first mention of a thing has special significance
			'things' often develop from simple to complex (or vice versa)
			idealogical coloring
		The Stereo Law
			an identical mention of a thing in another context has special significance
			Luke 4:18-19 ~ Isaiah 61 (He stops at a comma, what's next?)
			
		Law of Structural Integrity
			the Bible pre-answers heresies before they are invented
			John 1:1
			John 12 ()
		Law of Recurrence
			important ideas are scattered throughout (spread spectrum :)
		Law of Dichotomies
			many Biblical ideas are forehead-slappers
				many of these involve an understanding of time/space that we cannot have
			election vs. calling
			trinity
