	Testament ~ akin to a covenant

	Canonical
		= officially accepted

How?
	Approaches
		rational - scripture is only as valid as we judge it to be
		mystic - quickening, experience
			"true" mysticism is revelation via the Holy Spirit
			false mysticism is where final determination is made anywhere but in Christ
		romantic - equating tradition with Scripture
		neo orthodoxy - says the Bible is not the Word of God
			man determines what is/isn't Word in Scripture
			...multiple "correct" interpretations
		cultic - addition or subtraction
			equating other scriptures with Scripture (LDS)
			removing from or altering Scripture (JW)
		orthodoxy - Bible is supreme and final

	Inspiration
		verbal = in the form of words (verbage)
		plenary = unqualified, fully attended
		Divine superintendence
		Human authorship
		duality
			Exodus 20:12 - words God spoke (v.1)
			Matthew 15:4 - God "commanded"
			Mark 7:10 - Moses "said"

	Infallibility
		inerrancy = incapable of being wrong
		precision = every thought perfectly placed

	Illumination
		= clarification (also, decoration ~ remez)
		also = decoration
			remez ~ "hint" of something deeper
			
	Transmission
		40 authors
		66 books (49 "original")
		3 languages (Hebrew, Greek, Armaic)
		Israel; Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Arabia, 'Turkey'
		Authors - kings, priests, prophets, soldiers, statesmen, shepherds, fishermen, tax collector, doctor, Pharisee, farmer
		tent-maker ~ skenopoios (tabernacle maker/doer)
		Scripture is indestructible
			1Pet 1:23-25
			with a warning to meddlers: Rev 22:19

	Interpretation
		= removing obscurity
			e.g. psephology ~ psephos + logos (pebble knowledge, i.e. counting) = study of elections
		= a conception of another's _____
			exigesis = explainable, "to lead rightly"
			eisigesis ~ a hybrid of 'eis' (meaning into) and 'gesis' as above
			Discernment = perception of right and wrong

			
	Levels of Inspiration
		historical
		prophetic
		allegorical
		implication
			remez = hint
			allusion rather than exposition
				patterns
				"prophecy is pattern"
				names
			symbology (plants, animals, woods, metals)
			numbers, syllabic meanings, meta-data (tread lightly)
			ELSs (tread lightlier)
		examples
			Noah's genealogy
			Isaiah 37
			Paul's conversion and later testimony (Acts 9 & 26)
			John 1:1

	Laws of Interpretation
		The Golden Rule - WHEN THE PLAIN SENSE OF SCRIPTURE MAKES COMMON SENSE...TAKE IT!
			primary, literal, ordinary
				'secondary' importance is implied for other levels of interpretation
			rationalism
			context vs. pretext (beware the eisigesis)
		Law of First Mention
			= the first mention of a thing has special significance
			'things' often develop from simple to complex (or vice versa)
			idealogical coloring
		The Stereo Law
			an identical mention of a thing in another context has special significance
			Luke 4:18-19 ~ Isaiah 61 (He stops at a comma, what's next?)
			
		Law of Structural Integrity
			the Bible pre-answers heresies before they are invented
			John 1:1
			John 12 ()
		Law of Recurrence
			important ideas are scattered throughout (spread spectrum :)
		Law of Dichotomies
			many Biblical ideas are forehead-slappers
				many of these involve an understanding of time/space that we cannot have
			election vs. calling
			trinity
